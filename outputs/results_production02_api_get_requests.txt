         <CompanyDescription>The Mission of MIT Collaborative Initiatives is to promote a systems-based approach to solving deep-rooted societal issues by engaging experts from a broad range of disciplines both within and outside the scope of a problem. 

It is the belief of the Collaborative that many of today's most challenging issues can benefit from outside expertise. Debate among experts is valuable but is often self-perpetuating. Adding viewpoints from outside the conversation broadens the debate and may lead it in new directions. The Collaborative's intentions are not to compete with people and organizations involved in addressing critical issues, but to swell the wave by broadening the discussion. 

In addition, the Collaborative has come to believe that a systems-based approach is vital to challenging widespread societal issues. Systems thinking looks at the interconnectivity of actions and studies a problem as a whole. This approach considers the system as a sum of its parts where a change in any one part has system-wide ramifications. Without this global view much time can be spent addressing issues in a single part of what is ultimately a comprehensively flawed system. 

The Collaborative applies its Mission in two basic models:


We bring people together to instigate challenging discussion and debate around a given issue or set of issues. 

Often, the Collaborative is approached to bring a significant group together around a specific topic and facilitate constructive dialogue. At other times, the Collaborative identifies areas that it feels could benefit from this type of broad discussion and initiates the meetings. 

Meetings range in size and scope, and the Collaborative takes on large group meetings-in a discussion format-if it feels that a broad discussion across silos and with outside input could be beneficial. The Collaborative is currently focused on healthcare, but has facilitated these types of meetings around issues in global health, global finance, and other areas of widespread concern. We target specific areas of interest and develop projects by identifying and advising a project team, engaging influential external advisors, and building project objectives to apply a systems approach to various arenas. 

The ultimate goal of MIT Collaborative Initiatives is to shrink the existing gap between the way we think and what the world actually needs, and to encourage and develop innovative solutions to the enormous challenges that we as a society face in the beginning of the 21st Century. </CompanyDescription>

August 2005, Professor Jung-Hoon Chun and Dr. David Brock visited the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to discuss the goals and objectives of the MIT Data Center in the area of the building of an interoperable computer system to link models and data together within a network. NIST recognizes that this type of basic infrastructure has important implications to business in terms of manufacturing productivity and improved integration of data and mathematical models. 

At the conclusion of the meeting, NIST agreed to formalize a collaborative agreement with the MIT Data Center, the goal being further research, development, and implementation of the M Language and Dictionary. This will include frequent consultations and participation in the various programs of the MIT Data Center, in addition to a program for graduate students doing thesis work in the area. 

NIST is an agency located within the Commerce Department's Technology administration. The agency has participated in a number of technological innovations since its establishment in 1901. These include image processing, DNA diagnostic chips, smoke detectors, and automated error-correcting software for machine tools. The agency conducts a number of research programs including the Information Technology Laboratory.

         <CompanyDescription>The MIT Global Startup Workshop (MIT GSW) was founded in 1997 when the MIT $50K (now $100K) Entrepreneurship Competition received numerous queries from around the world from organizations interested in starting and improving their own business plan competitions (BPCs). The first MIT GSW was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts in March 1998 and brought together an international community committed to launching BPCs to stimulate and nurture entrepreneurship worldwide. 

A decade later, having helped grow and mature the BPC community, in 2007 the MIT GSW expanded its mission to include all aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Today we continue to build stronger, more productive entrepreneurial ecosystems around the world and a diverse and dynamic global support network for entrepreneurs. 

The MIT GSW has been held on six continents (except Antarctica!), reached participants from over 70 nations, and grown to become the premier workshop for fostering global entrepreneurship. Our participants have founded BPCs, entrepreneurial support organizations, educational programs, and new startups, while gaining invaluable contacts and forging lasting relationships.

         <CompanyDescription>Global MITS was founded in 2007. While serving as the IT Manager of a large Semi-Conductor Equipment Manufacturing company in the Greater Boston Area, the current Owner was approached by a group of people who had just started a Bio-Med company. He was asked to set up and maintain an inexpensive yet reliable network. After working with them and maintaining their network for several years, he realized that small to medium sized companies needed to have inexpensive, reliable 24/7 IT solutions, and so he began building the business on that principal. In 2010 he partnered with a group that excelled in remote monitoring and help desk services. By joining forces Global MITS now had the ability to provide full service solutions to the SMB market at competitive prices. 

Global MITS can design, build or rework your current network and stay in line with your company budget. We strive to provide you with the best solution at the lowest cost. We won't sell you products or services you don't need or want. If you're a small to medium, new or established business and you're looking for the ideal IT solution to fit your company structure and budget, Global MITS is the partner for you. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The Mission of MIT Collaborative Initiatives is to promote a systems-based approach to solving deep-rooted societal issues by engaging experts from a broad range of disciplines both within and outside the scope of a problem. 

It is the belief of the Collaborative that many of today's most challenging issues can benefit from outside expertise. Debate among experts is valuable but is often self-perpetuating. Adding viewpoints from outside the conversation broadens the debate and may lead it in new directions. The Collaborative's intentions are not to compete with people and organizations involved in addressing critical issues, but to swell the wave by broadening the discussion. 

In addition, the Collaborative has come to believe that a systems-based approach is vital to challenging widespread societal issues. Systems thinking looks at the interconnectivity of actions and studies a problem as a whole. This approach considers the system as a sum of its parts where a change in any one part has system-wide ramifications. Without this global view much time can be spent addressing issues in a single part of what is ultimately a comprehensively flawed system. 

The Collaborative applies its Mission in two basic models:


We bring people together to instigate challenging discussion and debate around a given issue or set of issues. 

Often, the Collaborative is approached to bring a significant group together around a specific topic and facilitate constructive dialogue. At other times, the Collaborative identifies areas that it feels could benefit from this type of broad discussion and initiates the meetings. 

Meetings range in size and scope, and the Collaborative takes on large group meetings-in a discussion format-if it feels that a broad discussion across silos and with outside input could be beneficial. The Collaborative is currently focused on healthcare, but has facilitated these types of meetings around issues in global health, global finance, and other areas of widespread concern. We target specific areas of interest and develop projects by identifying and advising a project team, engaging influential external advisors, and building project objectives to apply a systems approach to various arenas. 

The ultimate goal of MIT Collaborative Initiatives is to shrink the existing gap between the way we think and what the world actually needs, and to encourage and develop innovative solutions to the enormous challenges that we as a society face in the beginning of the 21st Century. </CompanyDescription>

August 2005, Professor Jung-Hoon Chun and Dr. David Brock visited the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to discuss the goals and objectives of the MIT Data Center in the area of the building of an interoperable computer system to link models and data together within a network. NIST recognizes that this type of basic infrastructure has important implications to business in terms of manufacturing productivity and improved integration of data and mathematical models. 

At the conclusion of the meeting, NIST agreed to formalize a collaborative agreement with the MIT Data Center, the goal being further research, development, and implementation of the M Language and Dictionary. This will include frequent consultations and participation in the various programs of the MIT Data Center, in addition to a program for graduate students doing thesis work in the area. 

NIST is an agency located within the Commerce Department's Technology administration. The agency has participated in a number of technological innovations since its establishment in 1901. These include image processing, DNA diagnostic chips, smoke detectors, and automated error-correcting software for machine tools. The agency conducts a number of research programs including the Information Technology Laboratory.

         <CompanyDescription>The MIT Global Startup Workshop (MIT GSW) was founded in 1997 when the MIT $50K (now $100K) Entrepreneurship Competition received numerous queries from around the world from organizations interested in starting and improving their own business plan competitions (BPCs). The first MIT GSW was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts in March 1998 and brought together an international community committed to launching BPCs to stimulate and nurture entrepreneurship worldwide. 

A decade later, having helped grow and mature the BPC community, in 2007 the MIT GSW expanded its mission to include all aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Today we continue to build stronger, more productive entrepreneurial ecosystems around the world and a diverse and dynamic global support network for entrepreneurs. 

The MIT GSW has been held on six continents (except Antarctica!), reached participants from over 70 nations, and grown to become the premier workshop for fostering global entrepreneurship. Our participants have founded BPCs, entrepreneurial support organizations, educational programs, and new startups, while gaining invaluable contacts and forging lasting relationships.

         <CompanyDescription>Global MITS was founded in 2007. While serving as the IT Manager of a large Semi-Conductor Equipment Manufacturing company in the Greater Boston Area, the current Owner was approached by a group of people who had just started a Bio-Med company. He was asked to set up and maintain an inexpensive yet reliable network. After working with them and maintaining their network for several years, he realized that small to medium sized companies needed to have inexpensive, reliable 24/7 IT solutions, and so he began building the business on that principal. In 2010 he partnered with a group that excelled in remote monitoring and help desk services. By joining forces Global MITS now had the ability to provide full service solutions to the SMB market at competitive prices. 

Global MITS can design, build or rework your current network and stay in line with your company budget. We strive to provide you with the best solution at the lowest cost. We won't sell you products or services you don't need or want. If you're a small to medium, new or established business and you're looking for the ideal IT solution to fit your company structure and budget, Global MITS is the partner for you. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Hotel@MIT was built to satisfy the need for a hotel that reflects MIT's spirit of innovation. Forest City Development Corporation and MIT forged a partnership to develop this venture. An MIT associate located on MIT property, the hotel and conference center features contemporary architecture outside and high-tech décor and amenities inside. Academics, businesspeople and travelers appreciate the whimsical, eclectic style and warm service. 

Recognized by its stunning exterior dome, our hotel anchors University Park Development, a premier office, high-tech and biomedical park near Central Square. The development offers a campus-like atmosphere in an urban setting. Its innovative master plan, developed by Koetter Kim and Associates, won the 1986 Urban Design Award from Progressive Architecture magazine. 

Arrowstreet was the architectural firm for the hotel, and Ahearn Schopfer and Associates provided the eclectic interior design. Hotel@MIT is managed by Hilton Hotels.  </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>In July of 2002 the MIT Soaring Association merged with the Greater Boston Soaring Association . MITSA was founded in 1968 in order to bring the joys and benefits of safe soaring to the community at a reasonable cost. Activities include flight training, gliding encampments, aircraft maintenance and social events. 

Cost reduction is achieved through the Club concept; MITSA is a volunteer organization where each member is expected to do his or her share in the considerable amount of work associated with soaring. Club policies and procedures are made by an elected board of directors. 

MITSA strives to provide a complete soaring environment. Primary instruction is available for the first time pilot as well as advanced training and activities in cross country, badge and contest flying for the more experienced member. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>WD Partners has been providing architecture and engineering services for ExxonMobil since 1996. As the global prototype architects, WD was asked to develop a flexible family of prototypes so that ExxonMobil could easily use different sizes and configurations in its major market areas. 

Because materials, methods of construction, and construction skill levels differ widely around the world, standards and specifications are critical to ensuring that stores are brand-right, consistent, and operationally efficient, not to mention opened on-schedule and on-budget. WD's highly detailed and prescriptive prototype set of A/E construction documents provide specifications that limit variations in equipment and materials, while still allowing for adaptation to local practices and conditions. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>UniKeep firmly believes in the conservation of both ecological and economic resources. For over 20 years, UniKeep has sustained an environmentally conscious reputation beginning with our patented and award-winning Safety-sleeve® product. This unique sleeve design offers superior disc protection, manufactured of 100% recyclable polypropylene, as well as significant material and weight reduction. Standard Safety-sleeve® products have the exact height and width dimensions of a hard plastic jewel box, but the Safety-sleeve® thin profile uses less than 1/4 of the space of a jewel box. 

UniKeep's EcoEndure™ environmentally responsible products allow us to offer many of our standard products manufactured from a variety of eco-friendly materials, including: biodegradable polypropylene, PLA (polylactic acid) film that is made from plants, and products made from up to 85% recycled polypropylene. Our EnvyPak™ product line provides environmentally sound choices for marketers, designers and the direct mail industry. 

The UniKeep U-1000 system was designed to offer a totally automated and flexible solution to an unlimited range of disc packaging requirements with the capability and reliability to meet high and growing production demands. It also requires less raw material since the profile of all finished sleeves have a uniform 5&quot; height and the rolls of polypropylene are all provided to cut to size, leaving no trim waste. 

Aside from our eco-friendly products, UniKeep incorporates green initiatives into many aspects of our manufacturing and disposal methods, including:


Reduce:
The lighting in our warehouse is on motion sensors so they are only on when someone is in that area, providing a 20% reduction in electricity usage. We use municipal water instead of ethylene glycol in our mold chilling system, reducing the amount of chemicals into the waste stream. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Founded in 1999, GoAntiques is now the antiques shopping destination of choice for millions of collectors and the online storefront for hundreds of dealers and gallery members around the globe. With offices in three states and two countries, we continue to grow our core business while focusing on customer satisfaction. 

Our staff of dedicated individuals is the lifeblood of our business. Their number one priority is to ensure that while visiting the GoAntiques site you have a pleasant shopping experience. We understand that half the fun of shopping for antiques is walking through a small town and discovering a treasure, however we try to compensate for the loss of that experience by providing you with the opportunity to access inventory that you may not otherwise see. The very proprietary nature of antiques is what makes GoAntiques a perfect web-based business. It would be impossible to imagine a single antiques store with the selection of products we offer, just as it is impossible to imagine a single antiques store with a customer base such as ours. By combining the inventories of our dealer members and using proprietary technology, we are able to bring together an otherwise impossible business. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>PRIME3SG was originally founded in 1999 as a fast-growing, minority business enterprise under the name &quot;3SG Corporation. The vision began as helping companies &quot;go digital&quot; and ease their problems storing, locating, filing and retrieving paper, microfiche, and microfilm documents. Due to company growth, 3SG Corporation formally merged with PRIME AE Group, Inc. in November of 2013. Joining forces, PRIME AE Group, Inc. created the subdivision &quot;PRIME TECH&quot; with the backing of 3SG Corporation key leaders, as well as additional key personnel. In 2015, due to an overwhelming number of clients asking for the 3SG name to remain, PRIME TECH became PRIME3SG. 

The merge with PRIME AE Group, Inc. allowed PRIME3SG to expand further and offer additional technology services to fully include: Enterprise Information Management; Geographic Information System Solutions; Network and System Architecture; Document Conversion and Data Migration; and Project Management Services. PRIME3SG prides itself on creating technology solutions aimed towards increasing productivity; reducing paper usage; reducing operating costs and increasing annual revenue for our clients across several markets. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Aer Arann operates over 600 flights per week across Ireland, the UK, France, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands. Passenger numbers have grown from 12,000 in 1999 to forecast passengers of 1.3m in 2008 across over 40 routes. Aer Arann is now Ireland's largest regional airline, and is the third largest airline flying into Dublin Airport. 

Aer Arann place huge emphasis on the quality of the service we provide to our customers. The company's excellence in customer service was recognised in 2006 by receiving the Palme D'Or European regional airline award for sustained excellence, reinforcing the airline's belief that providing a progressive airline service doesn't have to compromise the human touch. Aer Arann also holds the ISO 9000 Quality Award, and became the first European airline to achieve this accolade in 1994. 

As part of a €180 million investment, Aer Arann welcomed two of the ten ATR 72-500 ordered in 2007. The new ATR 72-500 is the first of ten new aircraft to be delivered over the next two years. By 2009, all of the Aer Arann fleet will be brand new. The ATR 72-500 offers Aer Arann customers new levels of comfort and efficiency. Several factors combine to make the ATR an environmentally friendly aircraft: lower emissions of CO2 due to reduced fuel burn, 70% lower fuel consumption than a jet on similar routes, and new standards in the industry for quietness. The new aircraft has resulted in much improved customer experience, reliability and operational economics. 

Aer Arann has aircraft bases in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Waterford. The airline has its own new purpose built hangar at Galway airport, which houses the main engineering base for Aer Arann. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Warner Chilcott is a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing and selling branded prescription pharmaceutical products in women's healthcare and dermatology in the United States. We have established strong franchises in these two areas through our precision marketing techniques and specialty sales forces of approximately 400 representatives. We believe that our proven product development capabilities, coupled with our ability to execute acquisitions and in-licensing transactions and develop partnerships, such as our relationship with LEO Pharma A/S, will enable us to sustain and grow these franchises. Our franchises are comprised of complementary portfolios of established branded, development stage and new products, including our recently launched products, Loestrin® 24 Fe and Taclonex®. Our women's healthcare franchise is anchored by our strong presence in the hormonal contraceptive and hormone therapy categories and our dermatology franchise is built on our established positions in the markets for psoriasis and acne therapies. In April 2006, we launched Loestrin® 24 Fe, an oral contraceptive with a novel patented 24-day dosing regimen, with the goal of growing the market share position we have achieved with our Ovcon® and Estrostep® products in the hormonal contraceptive market. We also have a significant presence in the hormone therapy market, primarily through our products femhrt® and Estrace® Cream. In dermatology, our psoriasis product Dovonex® enjoys the leading position in the United States for the non-steroidal topical treatment of psoriasis. We strengthened and extended our position in the market for psoriasis therapies with the April 2006 launch of Taclonex® the first once-a-day topical psoriasis treatment that combines betamethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, with calcipotriene, the active ingredient in Dovonex®. Our product Doryx® is the leading branded oral tetracycline in the United States for the treatment of acne. In 2005, we launched Doryx® delayed-release tablets. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Clerys was founded as one of the world's first purpose built department stores on Dublin's main street, O'Connell Street, in 1853. Over the years it has witnessed many of the most significant historical events in the foundation of the State. Clerys main store is a listed building due to its architectural significance and historic role in the City. 

In 1941 the shop was purchased by a local draper Mr. Denis Guiney who ran the enormously successful retail emporium of Guineys on Talbot Street. He brought the philosophy of high volumes and low prices formula to the Clerys Store and transformed it into Ireland's premier shopping destination, bustling with shopper's assured of good quality merchandise at great prices. Mr. Guiney passed away in 1967 leaving the running of the store to his late wife, Mrs. Mary Guiney who survived her husband until 2004. Today the business continues to be run by the Board of Directors on behalf of the shareholders who are mainly relatives of Denis and Mary Guiney. 

A complete refurbishment of the store was completed in 2004 at a cost of €22m. Focusing on the needs of the modern customer, each floor was totally revamped to offer customers a truly modern shopping experience while keeping in mind the heritage and architecture of the store. The store retains many listed structures including a marble staircase, columns, decorative plasterwork and original joinery. 

2004 also saw finalisation of the redevelopment of O'Connell Street by the City Council with enhanced pedestrian spaces and new alignments of granite cut paving. The Spire of Dublin now rises 120 meters high outside the store on the O'Connell Street Plaza, at the heart of Dublin and opposite the General Post Office. 

The myriad of brands available in Clerys is one of the reasons why the store remains so popular to this day. It caters for all tastes and is Ireland's only full line Department Store. 

In October 2006, Clerys opened its third Home Furnishings store in the Globe Retail Park, Naas, which adds to existing furnishings branches in Leopardstown and Blanchardstown, which opened in 1997 and 1999 respectively. These stores, along with our existing furnishings department in Clerys, are devoted to providing a unique range of high quality furnishings from all over the world. 

In 2006, the O'Connell Street store was awarded the 'Best Independent Department Store' award in Britain and Ireland by Drapers magazine, a noted trade and industry publication. The store's success at the awards ceremony is testament to the appeal of the store and why thousands of customers come through the doors every day in the expectation of receiving superior qua lity products, brands and service at best prices. 

Most recently Clerys was the recipient of the Green Retailer of the year 2010 award. </CompanyDescription>

Such a large and busy organisation has a big story to tell, and strong information design was required not only to organise &amp; position the content, but also to allow visitors of the site numerous routes to the content they required, depending on their own perspective. 

Communicraft successfully imported a huge volume of content from an earlier version of the MHC website, reorganized into an intuitive new information structure. 

Communicraft successfully imported a huge volume of content from an earlier version of the MHC website, reorganized into an intuitive new information structure. 

The site also allows users to register for events and to subscribe to their popular insights, e-zines and tech law blog. 

I've worked with many technology teams over the past twenty years. Few compare in terms of quality and technical ability with the Communicraft team. They bring a deep technical mastery and a clear customer focus to their work and I'd have no hesitation in recommending them for application development. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Eblana Photonics has its origins in advanced research programs in photonics involving Ireland's leading Universities and Research Centres including Trinity College Dublin and the National Microelectronics Research Centre (now Tyndall National Institute). The company was founded in 2001 by Dr. James O'Gorman and Prof. John Hegarty both of whom had carried out research in lasers for data communications at Bell Laboratories (the R&amp;D arm of AT&amp;T). Prior to establishing the company, James had managed the Optronics Ireland facility at Trinity College, Dublin whereas John went on to be appointed Trinity's provost. Eblana was established out of a common desire to commercialise a scalable laser manufacturing technology which had the capacity to drive down the cost of high performance, single wavelength lasers for diverse mass market applications. 

We owe the name Eblana to the Alexandrian cartographer Ptolemy who flourished in the first half of the 2nd century. Ptolemy's famous maps place Eblana Civitas in the same location as today's Dublin city. For nearly 1500 years his maps were considered the most reliable and indeed formed the basis for the exploration of the New World. 

Eblana has solid links with Trinity College Dublin, Dublin City University, Tyndall National Institute and other global centres of expertise in laser physics and semiconductor device fabrication. In addition our pivotal role as lead supplier of laser components to EU sponsored research projects means that we remain at the forefront of technological developments in photonic systems for advanced communications and other sectors. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>We specialize in custom business web and database solutions and workflow optimization for small to medium-sized businesses. 

Whether it's custom accounting, manufacturing, inventory or CRM software, Boomcycle creates fast, robust and maintainable business infrastructure support systems by emphasizing best-practices software architecture and development, project management, source code and documentation standards, comprehensive automated testing and strict quality control. 

Large software consulting companies make money by selling off-the-shelf software &quot;solutions&quot;, which typically must be heavily customized in order to make the software work for the client. Boomcycle has the expertise to leverage your current investment in software by working with the systems you already have in place. In many cases, there is no need to implement an entirely new system. Often, we can work with the software that you have, enhancing the capabilities of your investment in your infrastructure. 

Why Hire Technical Employees When You Don't Have To? 

Periods of high activity come and go but employees are with you for the long-haul. The good news is that you can ramp up your capabilities quickly with Boomcycle's work-from-home workforce of super-sharp IT knowledge workers. And this is not some &quot;HR guy's idea&quot; - Boomcycle was founded by a software engineer with over 25 years of experience in the programming trenches as a developer and project manager. Leverage our over 10 years of experience helping businesses like yours grow with an as-needed workforce. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The Irish Dairy Board was established in 1961 to band together a handful of small dairy farms throughout Ireland and harness their collective expertise. That fateful year resulted in the creation of the Kerrygold brand, a premium line of crafted cheese and butter made all across Ireland but sold under one brand name. 

Now, more than 50 years later, Kerrygold sales are nearly $2 billion with products available in over 80 countries. We still adhere to the same small farm approach and still rely on independent dairy farmers to supply the finest milk in the world. It's why each one of our products really are a little slice of Ireland itself. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>With the 2011 GRAND-AM Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge championship winding down, Dublin, Virginia's BimmerWorld Racing continues to make progress with its expanded four-car operation. 

Driven by two additional goals this season-to develop brand-new Grand Sport-class BMW M3 V8s during the 10-round GRAND-AM championship and to shape those M3 V8s into contenders-BimmerWorld met its objectives once again at New Jersey Motorsports Park, site of Round 9. 

BimmerWorld team owner/driver James Clay and co-driver Seth Thomas demonstrated the growth of the team's GS program once again, climbing from a starting spot of 15th to run as high as second during the 2.5-hour race. 

In the sister No. 78 BimmerWorld BMW M3 V8, Gregory Liefooghe stepped up from the team's No. 81 Street Tuner-class BMW 328i for the second time in 2011 and put on drive with new teammate Chris Ronson that was nothing short of amazing. 

Temperatures over 100 degrees during the race made conditions miserable for the drivers and crew, caused tires to overheat and created general mayhem, yet Clay and Thomas traded positions inside the top 10 before ending the day in seventh, their best finish of the season and the top result for BimmerWorld on the day. 

Coming off of a 10th at the previous round in Monterey, Clay says he's feeling positive about the direction the GS program is headed. 

&quot;Certainly I am very happy with the momentum we have, and seeing the program progress so that we have the equipment to be consistently in the hunt is important. I knew going into our 2011 GS program that it would be a development year, and it would certainly be frustrating at times as we have become accustomed to being at the front in every series we race in, but the affirmation and results for the effort at this point of the game are rewarding. Greg and Chris did an awesome job in New Jersey in the No. 78 running up front, and Seth and I pulled out another top 10 finish for the team. We are getting geared up for a strong 2012.&quot; 

Amidst the many responsibilities Clay carries-from running his four-car team to developing BimmerWorld's expanding base of corporate sponsors, serving as one-half of the No. 79s driving team also falls on his shoulders. As he shares, being able to don his helmet and get down to business behind the wheel is also a rewarding part of the job. 

&quot;First and foremost, the BimmerWorld team did an exceptional job at New Jersey, so that made me proud,&quot; he said. &quot;The temperatures and conditions were brutal and as a driver, I had to leave my team owner hat at home to perform at the level required on-track. But the crew had a more demanding job than the drivers in the car this weekend - the workload was relentless. They distinguished themselves once again on pit lane with more incredible pit stops. The knowledge that they are 100 percent on it and driven to succeed gave me the ability to do my job behind the wheel and enjoy the results of our collective effort.&quot; 

Race strategy also played a crucial role during an event where managing heat exhaustion, caution periods and avoiding contact weighed into the team's plans. The regular practice of changing drivers at the one-third mark of the race was replaced with splitting the time in the car equally to keep from wearing out the finishing driver. The team also made bold moves to pit toward the end of a yellow flag, which helped the GS cars to gain positions as the race played out. 

Beyond the race itself, and as part of an expanded relationship with CRC Industries to promote its Brakleen brand, BimmerWorld hosted its partners from CRC during the weekend, providing first-rate hospitality and giving their ardent supporters plenty to root for during the race. 

&quot;CRC/Brakleen was there en masse from their Pennsylvania headquarters to support the team this weekend,&quot; Clay continued. &quot;The company brought out over 150 employees, family members and guests and it was very rewarding to race around the track seeing so may Brakleen banners and knowing we were carrying the flag for them.&quot; 

The guests from CRC also witnessed a stirring performance from BimmerWorld's second GS entry. Showing his versatility in the GRAND-AM ranks, Liefooghe got up to speed immediately in the No. 78 BimmerWorld BMW M3 V8, motoring his way from 17th to third before handing off to Ronson. After jostling for positions and dealing with yellow flags, Ronson impressed on his way to finish 12th on his pro racing debut. 

Running deep inside the top 10 and working closely with Ronson were highlights of the event, according to Liefooghe. 

&quot;BimmerWorld always gives me a great race car. In this case, with the extreme temperatures, we only had one lap to qualify after which the tires would drop off by at least a full second. I missed the opportunity on that lap, but the car stayed very consistent, so even though I started mid-pack, I knew I had a lot more performance available. During the race, our car was great in the long runs. After fighting my way up from 17th, it felt great to challenge for the top spots just like we usually do in the ST cars, and Chris should also be proud of the job he did in his first GRAND-AM race.&quot; 

While BimmerWorld's GS cars enjoyed good runs at New Jersey, its ST cars found mixed fortunes in the race. 

2010 Rookie of the Year Bill Heumann and his teammate, two-time ST pole winner David White who finished on the podium at the 2010 NJMP event, pushed themselves in the heat in the No. 80 BimmerWorld BMW 328i to finish 14th in class. &quot;Given the extreme heat we made the decision to split the driving more evenly and didn't take advantage of an early driver change&quot; explained White. &quot;That turned out to be the wrong call with all the caution laps and we could never make back the track position lost in the pits.&quot; 

In the No. 81 car, John Capestro-Dubets was thrust into a similar position as Liefooghe, leading the charge for the second time this season when his regular teammate stepped up to BimmerWorld's GS team. 

Partnered with Jason Briedis, who was making his return to the series, the two mounted a solid run but saw their race slowed by suspension damage after being hit by a competitor. 

BimmerWorld's crew leapt into action to repair the car, but with extensive damage to overcome, the No. 81 went down three laps and fell from contention. Despite losing the possibility of earning a strong finish, Capestro-Dubets returned to the track determined to reward his team's efforts, recovering to finish 23rd in class. 

Giving up, as he explains, was never an option. 

&quot;Unfortunately, our results were limited by a racing incident but I always give a 100 percent whenever I get in the car. I believe that even with the circumstances we were dealt, I was able to show that determination is part of what's required as a professional. You can't quit or relax, no matter how much of a challenge you have. New Jersey was tough on everyone, but it gave me another chance to show how I've grown as a driver, thanks to my coach, Gregory Liefooghe, and to BimmerWorld for giving me the tools to deliver in a great car. 

&quot;When I got in my BMW we were three laps down with a tweaked alignment and yet I was able to run a fast pace the entire time. If I take anything from the weekend it is the ability to know that things don't always go the way you plan, and that you just have to keep pushing hard no matter what happens.&quot; 

Follow BimmerWorld's progress at www.BimmerWorldRacing.com as they prepare for the season finale at Mid-Ohio the weekend of September 16-17, and be sure to tune-in to watch the New Jersey race broadcast on SPEED this Saturday, July 30th at 3 p.m. ET. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Disk Hero develops solutions for companies concerned about data protection. Healthcare providers, in particular, are attracted to Disk Hero for their aggressive data security controls, low-cost services, and solutions that help companies with HIPAA-compliance. 

Disk Hero, developed by WebProfit, Inc., is a software service that provides continuous online data backup, data loss prevention and protection against identity theft. Disk Hero not only safeguards data in the event of a hardware failure, but also protects data in the event of theft, using a remote seek capability to locate missing hardware. 

Disk Hero has a scalable storage infrastructure. Customer data is replicated across multiple, remote data centers. &quot;Disk Hero provides users with enterprise-level reliability and scalability, at prices small businesses can easily afford. 

Disk Hero has extensive in-house expertise that helped to ensure Disk Hero's compliance with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). Prior to founding Disk Hero, WebProfit, Inc. spent nine years managing Blue Cross state sites web to internal data bridges as well and many nation wide home banking applications for banks and credit unions. 

Disk Hero's solutions help meet and exceed the HIPAA security requirements for transmitting and storing electronic private health information (EPHI). HIPAA's governing body requires that EPHI be transmitted and stored in an encrypted format. Disk Hero conducted rigorous in-house and beta testing to ensure our encryption and transmission protocols exceed HIPAA requirements.&quot; 

HIPAA's administrative safeguards require a data backup plan and that entities operating under HIPAA implement systems to store and ultimately retrieve exact copies of health records. Disk Hero helps ensure that health records and other sensitive information are stored to be HIPAA compliant. 

According to HIPAA standards, covered entities must have a contingency plan, and: &quot;Establish (and implement as needed) policies and procedures for responding to an emergency or other occurrence (for example, fire, vandalism, system failure, and natural disaster) that damages systems that contain electronic protected health information. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>At Northwoods, we make great software solutions for social services programs, but it's our people who make the real difference. 

Many of us have worked in human services for years and have an intimate knowledge of state and county social services programs and processes. This helps us understand and appreciate the needs and challenges of our customers, and allows us to hit the ground running on projects. 

Our human services expertise helps us analyze every agency's business processes and needs long before we install new software. It also helps us tailor our training to the specific requirements of human services agency workers and support our customers long after they use our software for the first time. 

To deepen our understanding of our customers, every year the entire Northwoods Team spends one week in the field with caseworkers and social workers. Being on the front lines gives us firsthand insight into workers' challenges and needs, as well as those of their clients. It also inspires us to keep working hard to deliver technology solutions that make the lives they touch a little better. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Since 1980, Hope Hospice has offered a variety of ways to help caregivers:


We begin by listening to the details of your family's experience. We offer advice on how you can &quot;get it off your chest&quot; to release the emotional and physical strain that you've accumulated. Family members often say that the insights we provide are very valuable. We also share tips on what to expect as your love one's illness progresses. 

After our preliminary discussion, if hospice care seems appropriate, the Hope Hospice team of professional caregivers will provide expert medical care in coordination with your physician's care plan. We also can provide a wide range of non-medical support, including help with personal care, such as bathing and light housekeeping. In addition, our team of highly trained, experienced volunteers is available to provide companionship and assistance as required. 

We're always ready with open hearts, minds, and ears to help ease your concerns and to provide emotional and spiritual support along the way. We can even help with financial issues and end-of-life planning. 

Contact us today to discuss how Hope Hospice can be by your side to care for your loved one. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>&quot;We are committed to providing safe, secure, and reliable service during normal and emergency conditions,&quot; says DSRSD Board President Georgean Vonheeder-Leopold, &quot;This is an emergency and I'm pleased with how quickly staff pulled together our Drought Response Action Plan and how quickly they're taking action to reduce potable water use in our service area.&quot; 

To set an example for our customers, the District has already done the following: turned off potable irrigation systems at all District facilities (primarily remote pump stations, because the landscaping around the District Office and the wastewater treatment plant is irrigated with recycled water); switched to recycled water to clean sewers; and ceased flushing hydrants except for critical areas where flushing is necessary to maintain adequate water quality. The District is also exchanging all potable water construction meters for recycled water construction meters, expanding recycled water use to as much landscape irrigation as possible (if the drought persists, outdoor potable irrigation may be restricted or even banned), and scheduling District experts to speak to community groups about what our customers can do to minimize the drought's impact. 

In late April, early May, the DSRSD Board will have a better understanding of the current rainy season and its corresponding impacts on the state's water supply, and may be asked at that time to consider additional policy decisions. Such considerations might include the following: adopting a drought stage and higher rates (Stage 1 water rates have a target goal of reducing water use by 10%, Stage 2 has a target goal of reducing water use by 20%, Stage 3 has a target goal of reducing water use by 35%, and Stage 4 has a target goal of reducing water use by 50%); implement affordability programs for customers who are already low-water users; enhance rebate programs with additional incentives; adopt appropriate mandatory conservation requirements, limitations, or prohibitions; and, enact appropriate enforcement action for customers who fail to comply with mandatory conservation requirements. 

The Board also endorsed the Association of California Water Agencies' Statewide Water Action Plan. This plan outlines 15 actions to improve water supply reliability, protect water rights, protect the integrity of the state's water system and promote better stewardship. 

Founded in 1953, Dublin San Ramon Services District serves 157,000 people, providing potable and recycled water service to Dublin and the Dougherty Valley area of San Ramon, wastewater collection and treatment to Dublin and south San Ramon, and wastewater treatment to Pleasanton (by contract).

         <CompanyDescription>Industry Insights has been serving the research needs of trade and professional associations, dealer organizations and other affiliated groups since 1980. Our company specializes in providing high-quality yet affordable survey research services which assist such organizations in better fulfilling the informational and educational needs of their affiliated members. 

Unlike other research, accounting or consulting firms that may engage in studies of this type as an offshoot of their main business, association and affiliated group research is all we do. Our team of knowledgeable professionals has decades of experience in providing survey research solutions to organizations such as yours. 

Because we currently process over 100,000 survey forms annually, we are highly sensitive to the confidential and proprietary interests of survey respondents. We're also sensitive to your need for timely delivery, accuracy and cost effectiveness. 

We have proven methods for achieving high response rates, and because we serve as an objective third party, we can often obtain information that is otherwise unavailable. 

Finally, Industry Insights' clients are often surprised to learn that they can get high-quality, professional results for considerably less than it would have cost them to attempt a project in-house. Regardless of the project size, big or small, we can provide a total turn-key service, freeing your association staff of the details involved in conducting survey research. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Headquartered in Northern California, Eagle Shield is a privately-owned, profitable business with roots going back over 20 years. We are a recognized leader in our industry with thousands of satisfied customers across the country. As we rapidly expand our presence to each of the major U.S. markets, experts predict we will completely revolutionize the way America lives with lower utility bills and increased comfort throughout the year using clean technologies. 

We began this journey to radically change the way homes and buildings are protected to conserve energy, help homeowners save money, reduce green house emissions, and preserve the environment. We began with a revolutionary product-the world's most advanced high tech reflective insulation. In fact, Eagle Shield Radiant Barrier Reflective Insulation™ is the only insulation recognized by NASA and certified by the Space Foundation. 

But don't just take our word for it. The Department of Energy's Radiant Barrier Fact Sheet states that homeowners can expect up to 17% cooling savings depending on climate, current amount of insulation currently in the attic, and household energy use. Many of our customers say they have achieved even higher savings, but these results have not been scientifically verified by a 3rd party. We do know this: homeowners and businesses love it. It's clean and affordable, and it can be quickly and easily installed by one our trained employees right on top of any existing insulation in your home or business. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Steorn is a small company based in a two level office hidden in a nondescript corporate park in Dublin, Ireland. They're inventors of things useful if somewhat dreary, like security devices to prevent ATM fraud. But one way or another, that's about to change. Their latest product is either a brash scam, an onerous mistake, or the single most important discovery - ever. 

Orbo is the name Steorn has given to the technology based on an effect that they've supposedly uncovered. We still don't have many specifics about how it works, but here's what we do know. It's based on a specific arrangement of permanent magnets, and involves cyclical movement. Once one cycle is complete, more mechanical energy has been put out than was originally put in. Arrange this system so that it puts its energy back into the next cycle, and presto, you have the impossible - a perpetual motion machine. A wheel that will spin forever (or bob, or jitter - again we don't know the details yet) and in the process seem to create energy from nothing. Energy that could run an iPod, or a car; a furnace, or a spaceship. All without batteries or any kind of fuel. 

At this point, many of you will want to dismiss Steorn and its claims out of hand, to relegate them neatly into the class of fanciful dreams along with unicorns, faeries and Jedi mind tricks. And I don't blame you. If anything at all can be called &quot;scientifically impossible&quot;, it's the perpetual motion machine. The &quot;free energy&quot; produced by such a device would do much more than violate some obscure tenets of electromagnetic theory. It would fly in the face of what is probably the most fundamental and well established law in all of science - that matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, they can only change form. If Steorn's device does keep spinning indefinitely, it must be taking its energy from someplace, or else physics has to be rewritten from the ground up. 

I agree, Steorn's claims do sound extraordinarily unlikely. But I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for a few months, and here's why:


To my eyes, the people at Steorn are acting like they're convinced they have something real. We'll find out the truth this year - maybe as soon as July. Steorn is pressing ahead and has staked their credibility on going public with this technology in the coming months. In the remote chance that they have what they claim, everything changes. No person on Earth, indeed no living being, would be unaffected by this. 

I'm writing this blog for those of you who are interested in catching up with Steorn's story and in following it forward. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The HGTC Foundation is the fund raising arm of the College dedicated to raising and providing resources for HGTC's educational excellence and innovation. The Foundation is guided by a volunteer board of trustees composed of 21 business and community leaders from the College's six-county service area: Bleckley, Dodge, Laurens, Telfair, Wheeler, and Wilkinson Counties. 

The entertainment for the special event will be The Grapevine, Georgia's premier band from Macon. Guests will enjoy heavy hors d'oeuvres and dancing from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. The Grapevine has electrified audiences across Georgia for 20 years. In 2000, The Grapevine received the prestigious Band of the Year, awarded by the Atlanta Society of Entertainers.  

After six successful years of celebrity-waited dinners with entertainment, the Foundation has decided to change the theme of their special event. &quot;The goal of the Foundation is to raise money,&quot; said Ed Touchberry, HGTC Foundation president. &quot;The August special event should interest all types of folks.&quot; 

Those attending will be treated to heavy hors d'oeuvres and dancing to a diverse repertoire of music such as Motown, R&amp;B, Beach, Pop, and 60s- 70s- 80s- rock. &quot;The 10-member band will have the crowd in full participation before the night is over,&quot; said Jep Craig, HGTC trustee. 

To add some excitement to the event, the Foundation is sponsoring a drawing for $2,500 cash. Individuals may purchase cash drawing tickets for $50 each. The drawing will be held the night of the event; however, those purchasing tickets do not have to be present to win. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>PageFair is an international startup, with offices in Dublin, St. Louis and Prague. Founded in 2012, the company was initially funded by its founders with additional seed capital from Tribal Ventures, Frontline Ventures and Enterprise Ireland. Hundreds of publishers now use PageFair to measure the cost of adblocking and to display alternative non-intrusive advertising to adblockers. 

Year-by-year, we have seen online users become more technically-sophisticated and media-savvy. The traditional industry response has been to turn to more interruptive forms of advertising, which has only served to increase the popularity of adblock. At PageFair, we want to help create a more sustainable advertising ecosystem, one in publishers can focus on loyalty and engagement instead of traffic and clicks, and make money without depleting their audience's goodwill. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>IFG Group plc is a focused financial services company with full market listings in London and Dublin. The Group provides a range of financial solutions including full platform services, pensions administration and independent financial advice. 

Having successfully restructured the balance sheet and business portfolio in the early 2000s, the Group focussed on its core competencies and set about building highly stable, long term revenue streams growing organically and by acquisition. 

Acquiring James Hay in March 2010 and the subsequent successful integration catapulted IFG Group into the No. 1 position in the UK bespoke SIPP market. The acquisition was strategically consistent with our goal of occupying the leading position in each of our chosen markets. 

Since then, James Hay Partnership has evolved into being a leading platform provider in the retirement and wealth planning market supporting clients and their financial advisors with expert service and flexible, competitive products. 

The Group also owns award winning financial advisor Saunderson House. Based in the City of London, it provides objective adviceto private clients and organisations and has a reputation for transparency, excellent client service and an impressive investment performance track record. 

In recent years, the IFG Group has made a series of disposals, including IFG International, a provider of corporate and trust services in 2012, the businesses of IFG Financial Services, a traditional UK IFA and other minor disposals including IFG Asia, One Network and Siddalls France. 

On 11 December 2014, the Group completed the sale of IFG Ireland's pension, investments and advisory businesses. The General Insurance business in Ireland, which trades as ARB Underwriting, was not included in the transaction. 

The Group now has sharper focus with a strong balance sheet to further support and invest in the continued growth and development of James Hay Partnership and Saunderson House. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Bantry Technologies was established in 1999, and has become since a global company with customers on the five continents. As a result, the company is now recognised as the leading provider of SIM software, from operating systems to development and test tools. The company was formed from the gathering of experienced founders in the domain of Integrated Circuit cards, telecommunication and security. 

Bantry Technologies is not and does not intend to become a SIM card manufacturer. Although the company has developed key relationships with chip card manufacturers, the company has a golden rule which is to remain in the software space and let SIM card vendor handle the manufacturing and the customers' relationships. Our mission is to help not to compete. 

The marketplace in the smart card business is constantly evolving for the better. The roles and responsibilities in the value chain are changing since independent component suppliers are eager to add their own value in the overall process. Bantry Technologies' mission is to be the uncontested leader in the provisioning of independent operating systems (native or Java), development and test tools and value added services. 

Our mission is to offer the market a strong proposition focused around five main axes:


1. Interoperability and compliance with the various standards,
2. Offer an unrivalled level of control, security and flexibility to the customers,
3. Offer added value to the customers,
4. Ensure quality and delivery in a timely manner,
5. Offer challenging cost savings policy. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Established in 1979, McElvaney Motors is a Scania Dealer for Dublin and the North East as well as a Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles Partner. Employing more than 80 people in our head office in Monaghan and premises just off the M50 at Exit 5 in Dublin, we are one of the leading specialists in the provision of new and used trucks and vans, parts and workshop services in Ireland. 

Throughout the past 35 years, the company has achieved much success including the following:


Acquiring the prestigious Scania Dealership for the North East region in 1984.
In 1997, McElvaney Motors was accredited to ISO 9002. The company was the first Irish Dealer and the first European Dealer (other than Sweden), to be awarded the notable Scania Certification Dealer Operating Standard
The company is a Quinn Insurance Approved Repairer and a Lloyds Insurance Approved Repairer. Appointed VW Commercial Vehicles Partner in 2009


Recently, there have been significant additions to the services provided in both the Dublin and Monaghan workshops including the ability to service all makes of Vans, Coaches, Buses and Trailers. 

The range and selection of parts has also been extended to provide a full compliment of new, alternative and second-hand parts. Having identified a niche in the market, McElvaney Motors established Truck Dismantlers Ireland to provide top quality second-hand Scania and Volvo. This section of the business has developed dramatically in both the home and export markets since it's inception in 2001 and continues to go from strength-to-strength. 

Through extensive research, McElvaney Motors has identified that Tracking and Fleet Management Systems are becoming a necessity in today's dynamic and turbulent environment. Companies must continually operate at ever decreasing margins as well as face security and theft issues. Vehicle tracking can save you time and money, and give you a real competitive edge in your market sector. 

McElvaney Motors' success is based on the ability to continue to provide high quality trucks and parts (both new and used); complete workshop services and an excellent customer service that is unparalleled in the industry. The company's experience, combined with it's cutting edge technology, state-of-the-art equipment, variety of services and highly skilled employees make it a pioneer within the industry. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Ruritan National has nearly 30,000 members throughout the United States, that work to improve more than 1,100 local communities. Since the organization's beginning in 1928, Ruritan Clubs have served America with Fellowship, Goodwill, and Community Service. Ruritan is a civic service organization made up of local clubs in urban areas, small towns and rural communities. 

Ruritan's purpose is to create a better understanding among people and through volunteer community service, make America's communities better places in which to live and work. The slogan of Ruritan is &quot;Fellowship, Goodwill and Community Service. Club membership represents a cross-section of the community in which the club serves, and is not restrictive with regard to occupation, social position, or any other specific criteria. 

Unlike most civic service organizations, Ruritan rarely has national programs. Rather, each club surveys its own community as to the needs of that community and then works to meet some of those needs. Nearly all clubs work locally with FFA, 4-H and other organizations serving youth. Nearly one in every three Ruritan clubs sponsors a Boy or Girl Scout unit. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Nexvet Biopharma is developing safe, more effective and specific medicines for companion animals, (cats, dogs and horses). The Nexvet portfolio focuses on inflammatory disease, pain and cancer. The portfolio is composed of drugs based on successful human biologics drugs in these indications, converted to 100% species-specific versions by Nexvetâ€™s proprietary PETisationâ„¢ technology. 

PETisationâ„¢ converts biologics to species-specific analogues through a simple, rapid one-step process with a high success rate. For decades animal health companies have used drugs based on human health products with typically little optimization for the animal targets. Nexvet will address this shortcoming by introducing new highly optimized products in areas of greatest market need. 

The area of biologics has become a massive growth area in human medicine, responsible for many of the most effective drugs on the market. Biologics are drugs based on natural proteins with typically good efficacy, high specificity and an excellent side-effect profile. To date, innovation and competition in biologics in the $20 billion global veterinary pharmaceuticals market has been limited. Nexvetâ€™s team have international track records in developing human biologics combined with Veterinary expertise. Nexvetâ€™s expertise in biologics R&amp;D confers a strong competitive advantage and has generated an extensive intellectual property position, making Nexvet an attractive licensing partner and/or acquisition target. 

Nexvet is based in Melbourne, Australia, with partners and investors located around the world.

         <CompanyDescription>HSD is a human resource outsourcing company that was founded by Deborah Dwyer, its current president. Deborah first started the business with one employee and a fax machine. Since then, the company has grown to a team of resources including 4 data management specialists, 12 expert phone interviewers, 2 client services consultants, and 2 senior organizational development resources, and 2 on the administrative services team. 

HSD's purpose at the foundation of the company was to measure the health of an organization to achieve high performance and high involvement (now the common term is engagement!). 1992 also signified the year in which HSD's proprietary software was developed by Deb Dwyer's father, who had retired as the chief engineer at Delphi. Within just one year, HSD had completed three major surveys in the building and paper industries. 

That same year, a retention project team was led by Deborah Dwyer for an electronic publishing company. This study involved conducting interviews with former employees to better understand the barriers that women and minorities had regarding upward movement in the company. Ten years later this study became the main inspiration for HSD's Exit Interview service, ExitRight. During the first ten years of HSD, Deb was designing and facilitating hundreds of training sessions and workshops to enhance leader effectiveness and improve team performance. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Pownall and Hampson is a family-run company of bedding and quilt manufacturers, established in the 1930's in Coolock, Dublin. We cater to a steadily growing client base, providing consistently excellent service and beneficial advice. Clients in the home produce and hospitality industries recognise Pownall &amp; Hampson as a highly efficient and ethical supplier of bedding products. 

At Pownall &amp; Hampson, we consider ourselves more than just duvet and quilt manufacturers, but partners in business with our clients. We are committed to supporting our retailers every step of the way, providing a speedy production rate and direct delivery. We even include in-store support to help them present and promote this quality bedding in the most effective manner. We offer our retailers a choice of three prestigious brands, namely Bedroom Couture, Medibed and Neuhaus. 

Our contract manufacturing service involves supplying made-to-order bedding for a number of larger clients, including hotels, developers and nursing homes. These clients may also wish to start their own bedding brand, or be in search of a new manufacturer for their existing brand. Pownall &amp; Hampson provides excellent, customer-focused service for these clients. We greatly value the support and loyalty of our customers, and will always go the extra mile to ensure their needs are met. Currently, our successful client brands are Foxford, Dunlopillo and Arnotts Karla Bree Collection. 

The selection of quilts and duvets in our own brands and client brands offer anything a customer might require for a good night's sleep. Whether it's the convenience of washable synthetic fibres, the luxurious comfort of goose feathers, or the health benefits of hypo-allergenic materials, there are fillings and finishes to suit any preference. The duvets are available in several sizes and warmth classifications, to fit all beds in all seasons. The pillows we manufacture are also available in a range of fillings and different levels of firmness. Our mattress and pillow protectors come in a choice of quilted, waterproof and anti-allergy materials, for added convenience, comfort and peace of mind. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Vidiro are a digital video performance engineering company specialising in the discovery, development, and targeting of niche audiences for our clients. 

Our current customers range from leading media agencies, to global brands, to major technology companies, to leading consulting and insights businesses. 

Our VIDiRO PERFORM platform incorporates our belief that only when &quot;the technology disappears&quot; does it start to become really useful. Behind the scenes our technology incorporates some advanced machine learning and information retrieval algorithms we developed in-house along with many other innovations we've built into the system along the way. 

We were founded by Simon Factor and Kevin Magee who met @ CeADAR (www.ceadar.ie) with a shared vision of using analytics to solve some tricky challenges in the digital media industry. Keith Johnson joined not so long afterwards to build our business in the UK. 

Our founders share a similar outlook. They believe certain things are timeless - hard work, domain expertise and good old-fashioned accountability. That's what's got them to this point. 

It's been an exciting journey - and it is only getting started. 

VIDiRO are heavily involved in the Data Analytics ecosystem in Dublin, Ireland. We are founder members of the Irish government supported international Centre for Applied Data Analytics Research (CeADAR) where we collaborate on industry projects. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>WiredWedding.com is the leading provider of wedding websites on the internet. Wedding websites are quickly becoming the most popular tool used by couples to communicate essential wedding information to their guests. WiredWedding offers a unique and innovative product that gives couples an easy and fast way to create a wedding website and make it available on the internet. 

Formed in 2001 by two programmers, Paul Thompson and Derek Ochs, WiredWedding.com set out to change the way that wedding websites are created. 

Prior to WiredWedding.com, most couples were either creating their own web sites or using a &quot;pay and pray&quot; service where they would hire a web developer to create a website for them. This method was costly and made updates difficult. 

WiredWedding.com wanted to offer couples better option. Their goals were to: 1) allow couples to create a website in minutes 2) require no web experience 3) keep the cost low, and 4) allow couples to try everything for free. 

After some clever development, they eventually created a service with all of these features and many more. Since then, WiredWedding.com has been growing quickly, and thousands of couples have logged on to WiredWedding.com to create their dream wedding websites. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Kenmare Resources plc is a mining and minerals development company. The company has a dual primary list on the Irish and London Stock Exchanges. Its main asset is the Moma Titanium Minerals Project. 

The Moma Project is located on the coast of Mozambique in the province of Nampula, south of the port of Nacala. 

Feasibility studies on the Project were completed in February 2001 which provided a detailed assessment of all aspects of the proposed development and confirmed the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the Project. 

The detailed market analysis showed a strong market for the minerals produced. This information allowed Kenmare to approach Funding Institutions with the aim to finance the Project and then appoint a contractor to carry out the construction of the mine. Financing of the Project was subsequently put in place and construction of the Project, which began in August 2004, is in the final stages of completion. Section one of the project, which includes the mining pond, dredges, Wet Concentrator Plant and related infrastructure, has been taken over by Kenmare, and a taking-over certificate has been issued to the contractor. Mining and Heavy Mineral Concentrate production started at the Moma Mine on 25 April 2007. 

Kenmare also operated the Ancuabe Graphite Mine in Mozambique from 1994 to 1999 and established itself as one of the world's leading producers of high quality natural flake graphite. he mine is currently on care and maintenance and Kenmare is seeking new investors. 

Kenmare holds two mineral exploration licences in County Carlow, Ireland, which cover an area with potential tantalum mineralisation. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>ForeFront offers Web site design, development, content management systems, eCommerce sites, intranets and search engine optimization for clients in our hometown of Columbus, Ohio and around the world (yes, we have international clients, and yes, that makes us unbearably cool). 

Since we started life as a full-service marketing company, we have a better understanding of just how your Web site fits into your overall marketing scheme. It's why the decision was made to narrow our focus to web development - a good Web site serves as the linchpin for many successful businesses. And hey; who can't use a good linchpin? 

But if you really want to know what sets us apart (aside from our uncanny knowledge of obscure 80's songs and avoidance of socks) it's that we are a proactive web development firm. 

We don't sit back and wait for our clients to ask us about the latest web trends/gizmos/ponzi schemes, we consider it our job to let you know about them. After all, we are the ones surfing the net endlessly (&quot;it's research, boss, I swear!&quot;) and if there is one thing you should know by now about geeks, it's that we love to show people how much we know. 

It's just our little way of getting everyone back for all the wedgies. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>CCYHA provides Travel Hockey teams with ice scheduling, team apparel ordering, grievance management, referee scheduling, billing and registration services. CCYHA has an administration fee to help cover the costs and time to provide these services to teams under the CCYHA charter. CCYHA does not take a ,cut' from fundraising money collected on behalf of the team as this is viewed as self-serving and not consistent with the spirit and culture of the organization. All CCYHA Travel Hockey teams are self-funded and self-managed from a fiscal perspective. The teams arrange their finances to suit their individual needs.  A typical team budget is in the $20,000 - $25,000 range and individual costs may be around $1,500 - $2,500 (however fees have been as low as $700 and as high as $2,800 per player). These costs do not include travel related expenses such as gas, food, lodging, etc. The bottom line , the more fundraising and sponsorships the better!  It is important to CCYHA's relationship with The Chiller LLC and the Columbus Referee Association that team bills are paid promptly. CCYHA will provide the ice and referee bills to each team's manager with the expectation of prompt payment. Teams with overdue bills may be denied participation in CCYHA Travel Hockey with the expectation that ice time and/or referee availability will be taken from the team.  </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Excess Share Insurance Corporation (ESI) is the nation's largest provider of deposit insurance of credit union member share (deposit) accounts with balances in excess of the basic $250,000 insurance limits afforded credit unions insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) or American Mutual Share Insurance Corporation (ASI). The corporation's Excess Share (deposit) Insurance program helps protect the hard-earned savings of credit union members throughout the United States giving consumers greater confidence in the protection of their savings. 

ESI is an Ohio-based licensed property and casualty insurer authorized to insure consumer share (deposit) accounts in both federally and state-chartered credit unions in 32 states nationwide and the District of Columbia. The corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Mutual Share Insurance Corporation (ASI), a credit union-owned credit union share guaranty corporation operating since 1974, licensed by the Ohio Department of Insurance and dual-regulated by the Ohio Department of Insurance and the Ohio Department of Commerce. It was ASI that first pioneered the concept of Excess Share Insurance for credit union member deposits in 1981, and as demand grew, the corporation found it necessary to organized and charter a more specialized insurance subsidiary focusing solely on Excess Share Insurance needs nationwide. Chartered in 1993, ESI gradually expanded its reach to where it is currently serving the needs of over 200 credit unions representing accounting for over 8 million consumers nationwide. ESI is a private corporation, and it is not an agency of any state or federal government, and the insurance it provides is not backed or guaranteed by any state or federal government. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The Welcome Warehouse, Inc. is a faith based non-profit organization that provides a warehouse of opportunities, goods and services to those of us who are temporarily in need. 

Incorporated in July, 2006, the Welcome Warehouse is a 501(c)(3) organization which provides supportive services to our neighbors struggling to meet basic needs. Throughout the year, Welcome Warehouse operates Dublinâ€™s only free shop which supplies clothing and household goods to families in need. In addition, the organization offers an emergency household assistance fund, a furniture match program, a back to school outreach, computer education and a Christmas assistance program to people in the Dublin community experiencing a temporary hardship. As we get to know the people we serve, we are able to connect them with other community resources. 

The work of the organization began when a Dublin City School nurse and clinic aid were moved to action upon noticing an alarming number of Dublin school children who lacked basic essentials so many of us take for granted: a winter coat, boots, or a bed to sleep in. These women began collecting and distributing clothing, household items and furniture to families in need. The Dublin City School community rallied in support of this effort, but keeping pace with the needs became a strain and storage space was limited to spare bedrooms and basements. 

In light of this, a womenâ€™s Bible study group from Indian Run United Methodist Church responded to a challenge to meet a need in the community that God would multiply. It became their mission to secure donated space and set up a year round collection facility. Since then, Welcome Warehouse has taken the lead to unite a community who cares and neighbors who share. In 2011, the Free Shop provided material assistance to over 850 people referred by Dublin City School staff, the Dublin Food Pantry and area churches. 

Grounded by a commitment to serve those in the Dublin community who are in need, Welcome Warehouse is dedicated to our Founding Principles and invites community partners and volunteers to join in the effort. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Ion seeks to operate to high standards. Our core aim is to build strong sustainable businesses. We respect the position of all stakeholders, customers and communities who are impacted by our activities. 

Our portfolio companies each have their own social responsibility programmes. 

Topaz, probably our best known company and a major consumer brand in Ireland, has won 23 awards for excellence in the 18 months since the time of writing. This includes the Chambers Ireland award for CSR for its &quot;Driver Reviver&quot; campaign to reduce serious accidents; Deloitte awards as a &quot;best place to work&quot;; numerous staff training awards; and many awards for service quality including a recent &quot;Best Retail Company of the Year&quot; award. 

Topaz also has developed its own top quality fuel cleaning additive with BASF which makes it the most efficient standard fuel offering in its markets. Topaz previously partnered with UNICEF and it recently announced a major corporate partnership with AWARE. It also supports Temple Street Children's Hospital, Meningitis Trust, Simon Community and Barretstown and has seeded a thriving Jatropha community owned plantation in Haiti. 

Topaz sponsors a range of events which are drivers of activity in the regions such as the Donegal Rally, the Galway Volvo Ocean Race, the National Ploughing Championships and the Rose of Tralee. Further programmes are in contemplation. 

Health and safety is a top priority for all our companies and an area that we continually review as an active owner. 

Ion supports many charities directly, such as the Simon Community and Sightsavers International. Ion's people are involved in numerous charitable and community activities for example our CEO is a founder member of the Soul of Haiti Foundation and is a member of Cork University Foundation. 

In a changing world, where there is a greater realisation of the interdependence of all aspects of activity on each other to sustain a viable future, Ion seeks to make a full contribution. </CompanyDescription>

In accordance with that guiding philosophy, sport must be drug free and played in accordance with the spirit and letter of the rules. Under the Irish Sports Council Act 1999 the Council was given the task of combating doping in sport. Immediately the Council established the Irish Sport Anti-Doping Programme, which was launched in the autumn of 1999. It comprises three main elements; testing, education and research. The Council is proud to have put in place a Programme that is recognised nationally and internationally as of the highest quality. It makes a contribution to the development of Irish sport through guarding the ethical standards of sport and ensuring that competitors, mentors and spectators are involved with drug free sport. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Gambro is a global medical technology company and a leader in developing, manufacturing and supplying products and therapies for Kidney and Liver dialysis, Myeloma Kidney Therapy, and other extracorporeal therapies for Chronic and Acute patients. 

Kidney (renal) dialysis was the world's first extracorporeal therapy (i.e. a therapy that treats organ failure outside the body). Dialysis saves the lives of a growing number of patients every year, and innovation in the field is essential. The only current alternative to renal dialysis - kidney transplantation - is not an available option for most patients, due to a shortage of donor organs. 

Dialysis technology is now being developed for new applications such as liver dialysis and an emerging field of other extracorporeal therapies, to remove different fluids and toxins from chronically and acutely ill patients. 

For decades, Gambro has been first to market with many groundbreaking innovations. By designing and delivering solutions to dialysis clinics and intensive care units, Gambro offers not just improved treatment quality, but also improved efficiency. 

Gambro was founded in 1964 and has today 8 000 employees, 13 production facilities in 9 countries,, and sales in more than 90 countries. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Prevas is a technical IT company that has been helping companies in many different industries since 1985 to develop innovative products and solutions that increase their competitiveness and productivity. Here in the Nordic countries we've historically had very strong export industries. 

The challenge is in retaining and strengthening this position in a progressively globalized world where rapid changes in our business environments entail constantly tougher competition and increasing demands on adaptation and thinking along new lines. 

So that we can continue to be a strong and natural business partner for our customers, we are now further coordinating our assortment of services and products. 

The reason for this is to ensure that our customers are able to take advantage of Prevas' entire assortment and we've now assembled a central strategic sales team. This permits us to offer larger comprehensive undertakings to our customers, to work more proactively in helping them to see what new technological capabilities can provide in the way of competitive advantages and to more quickly adapt our services and products to their needs. 

&quot;At the same time we're changing the name of Management Consulting to Business Consulting and integrating its operations into our other business areas,&quot; says Prevas CEO K-G Ramström. &quot;This will be a more natural arrangement and provide a more optimal solution that better reflects customer needs. Our strength is in offering business-related consulting based on our deep understanding of our customers' technologies and business operations.&quot; 

Michael Friis, presently responsible for the Management Consulting business area, will become Head of Group Sales &amp; Marketing at Prevas while retaining responsibility for Prevas' services in Business Consulting. The change will be fully implemented during the fourth quarter of 2014. 

&quot;To maintain competitiveness in quickly evolving markets, intelligence and communication capabilities must increasingly be built into products and processes,&quot; says K-G Ramström. &quot;New technical trends such as connected devices, Internet of Things, Big Data and cloud services are being frequently discussed by our customers and create opportunities for companies to develop new innovative products, solutions and business models. Prevas' unique breadth and deep expertise within these areas make us a complete and strategic partner for our customers and we already have a number of collaborative arrangements.&quot; 

Prevas' operations will now be divided into two business areas - Product Development and Industrial Systems. At Product Development we're specialists in software, electronics and mechatronics for embedded systems, and we help companies to develop market-leading products. The Industrial Systems business area helps companies to increase their efficiency in production. The focus is on intelligent IT solutions within superordinate production control and production planning, decision-making support for production follow-up, maintenance systems as well as production logistics and automation. Solutions that have major impact on industrial productivity and consequently competitiveness. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>This was a pretty exciting website that we built with ExpressionEngine. We got to work with the design team at Juice Creative and found it a breeze to build it with ExpressionEngine. It was also our first time using an EE plugin called Structure. It is a great plugin that gives a hierarchical representation of your site pages in the back-end, making it simple for a client to find what piece of content they need to update. Needless-to-say, we'll be using Structure from now on with our clients. ExpressionEngine has a great following of developers and their are a lot of top quality plugins available for it because of that.

         <CompanyDescription>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, is an independent, international research institute. It was set up on 1 July 1966 by the Swedish Parliament as a foundation. The idea of establishing a peace research institute in Sweden was proposed by Prime Minister Tage Erlander in a speech in August 1964 commemorating Sweden's 150 years of unbroken peace. In November 1964 a Royal Commission was appointed to explore the proposal. The chairman of the Commission was Mrs. Alva Myrdal now a member of the Swedish Government with special responsi-bilities in the field of disarmament. The Royal Commission reported in January 1965 in favour of the creation of such an institute in Sweden. The Commission was convinced of the potential value of peace research and felt that Sweden was a natural place for it to be undertaken. The Swedish Government accepted the Commission's conclusions. The statutes of the Institute have been laid down by the Swedish Government and its funds are provided by the Swedish Parliament. SIPRI's annual budget for the current financial year is 2.55 million Swedish crowns or about US $500,000. The Institute is, however, independent of the Government in its operations. These are the responsibility of an international Governing Board. The policy adopted by the Board has been that the Institute should study problems in a pragmatic way and that it should select ques- tions which are important to the decision-makers in current inter- national politics. The Institute, following the recommendations of the Royal Commission, has so far concentrated on problems of dis-armament and arms regulation. The Board has also adopted the principle that the Institute should not take foreign funds if this might compromise its independence. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Clavia DMI was founded in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1983 by Hans Nordelius and Mikael Carlsson. In a basement in a south suburb of Stockholm they created the world's first dedicated digital drum for the commercial market, the 'Digital Percussion Plate 1'. Between 1983 and 1994, Clavia developed several groundbreaking digital percussion systems, and in 1995 they entered the synthesizer market with the world's first, and according to many still the best, 'virtual analog' synthesizer, the Nord Lead. 

Officially released products:


Digital Percussion Plate 1 
(pre-version 1983) 


In November 1983, Clavia DMI released their first pre-version of the 'Digital Percussion Plate 1'. With the Digital Percussion Plate 1, you could play 8-bit samples stored on removable EPROM cartridges. The product was an instant success. Never before could you play a sampled drum sound with such a great feel and response. The dynamics was great already in this first model.  

The product was showed to Greg Fitzpatrick, a pioneer, entrepreneur and musician that at the time was importing American synthesizers. He liked what he saw and believed in the product and made the first order for 25 pcs of the black version of the percussion plate. His positive attitude and initiative to help Clavia to reach other markets was a great help in the beginning. </CompanyDescription>

Diamyd Medical develops the diabetes vaccine Diamyd®, an Antigen Based Therapy (ABT) based on the exclusively licensed GAD-molecule.

         <CompanyDescription>Ultimately, Imego is a resource of expertise. Ensuring that our staff are of the highest quality, that they have access to state of the art laboratory facilities (link), and that we have a strongly defined philosophy should be seen as the foundation - the solid base upon which we have developed our seven technical platforms. 

We have created technical platforms in the following areas:


INS/IMU for navigation and motion tracking
Biofluorescence for organic molecule detection
Magnetic nano particles for organic-molecule detection, readout and communication with products, viscosity measurements, etc.
MIP - molecular imprinting for organic molecule detection
MER - Magneto Elastic Resonance for humidity and thickness detection, process control of curing mechanisms, organic molecule detection
Piezo-Electric Resonance for detection of pressure, impact, velocity, etc
RFID for a combined detection/measurement and communication solution


Starting from this platform, we can, quite literally, measure almost everything, although an adaptation to each application is necessary. Even though it is technically possible to create a measurement system, it can sometimes be impossible to meet the requirements of form factors, price, developing time, reliability, etc. 

Before we start work on a new platform, it is developed in research projects. Our recently launched RFID platform, for example, will be developed within an inter-Nordic project where the Swedish element is financed by VINNOVA. Another example of this is our participation in the European project, Biodiagnosis. This project will develop our skills in organic-molecule detection. However, the most important factor in developing Imego, our platforms, and our business model is annual government funding. 

The great advantage offered by focused work with these platforms is that we gain experience in each project - experience that we use in the next one. It is important for us to avoid doing things just once and then re-starting as this benefits neither our customers nor Imego. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Volvo is now offering a new vehicle to all UK emergency ambulance services to help meet front line rapid response requirements. 

The Volvo S80 Ambulance has been designed and built in conjunction with Wiman, one of Europe's leading ambulance manufacturers and is available in right hand drive guise from early November. 

It is the world's first ambulance to be given Whole Vehicle Type Approval and has been built with safety in mind for both crew and patient. 

By using the Volvo S80 platform, Volvo has produced an ambulance, which offers the handling characteristics of a car. This means it performs well when tackling heavy traffic conditions, has the ability to respond to incidents more quickly and efficiently than a full size ambulance and also offers superb driver and patient comfort. 

According to Volvo's ambulance sales manager Nick Vannozzi, the S80 is capable of changing the face of front line ambulance use and, to date, 25 UK ambulance services have requested to test-drive the new model. 

'With NHS ambulance trusts all being judged on incident response times, car-based ambulances such as the S80 can offer a real alternative to the standard ambulance,' he said. 

'The S80 offers significantly better performance and handling than most vehicles. Car-based ambulances have been used in Europe for some time, and we are confident the S80 can help cater for the changing needs of UK health authorities,' he added. 

The S80 ambulance costs between £53,000 and £65,000 depending on its specification, and is available with a choice of 170 bhp or 200 bhp engines, and with either a manual or automatic gearbox. Four-wheel drive is also available for those authorities that want to ensure their front line vehicles can tackle the most difficult of driving conditions. 

Drivers and passengers also benefit from the standard high level of Volvo S80 safety equipment including ABS, front and side airbags and safety belts with pre-tensioners. In addition, each S80 ambulance is equipped with a reinforced chassis and load compensating rear suspension. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>SSC, through separate subsidiaries, operates two separate and distinct ground stations in the Dongara area, respectively named Dongara West and Dongara East. 

Dongara West is owned, operated and maintained by SSC's US-based subsidiary, Universal Space Network (&quot;USN&quot;). It has been in operation since 2001, 8 years prior to USN's purchase by SSC. USN functions under US government approval and oversight and primarily serves US-Government and commercial customers. 

The Dongara East ground station is a new facility that is owned and operated by SSC, and its purpose is to provide services to the European, Asian and other civil space agencies and commercial space companies. Dongara East was used by SSC for supporting the docking between Shenzhou VIII and the Tiangong-1 experimental module. 

Each of the two facilities has its own control center and separate antennas and ground equipment. These facilities provide satellite ground station services to customers around the world. 

SSC and USN maintain separate and distinct capabilities between its Dongara West and Dongara East ground stations to fully serve the global satellite services markets. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>MathCore develops and supplies products and services that help professionals to understand and improve their products. 

There is no doubt that most companies face increasing pressure from competitors, customers, and owners to supply more complex and interesting products all the time. Consumers want it faster and cheaper. New technology is introduced with fierce speed and at the same time legislation and environmental issues put pressure on the requirement specifications that are presented to product designers. This drives the need for efficient virtual prototyping and we see as a result that the simulation market is exploding. 

However modeling and simulation today are often the exclusive assignment of a relatively limited group of computational engineers and researchers. This implies a severe limitation in the design process. We at MathCore strive to develop and supply solutions targeted not only at computational engineers and researchers, but rather to all engineers and researchers. 

At MathCore we can help you take advantage of the latest technology in modeling and simulation to improve and speed up the product development process. MathModelica and MathCode offer great time savings as well as a means to improve and optimize the design. Your engineers will be able to spend their time being creative and productive, making the most of their skills, understanding and improving your products. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Effnet was founded in Luleå, Sweden, in 1997 by scientists of the Luleå University of Technology with a goal to develop and commercialize new technologies for improving the performance of IP based networks. 

The scale and rapid growth of Internet has speeded up adoption of IP-based networking over various communication links including wireless and wired. This is enabling users to access the same applications they use over Internet, any time any where. It is essential to reduce the overhead of IP protocol family including UDP, TCP, RTP etc. in order to use the scarce resource, spectrum and bandwidth, efficiently. Effnet Header Compression product family saves bandwidth and improves quality of service and experience of applications. 

Through continued research and development efforts, Effnet has gained a unique expertise in IP header compression and its team has actively contributed to the standardization process. Effnet Header Compression product family based on advanced header compression algorithms was introduced during 2001. Since then it is growing in number of products and features as well as improving in quality and efficiency. 

Effnet's engineering team has long experience within header compression technologies which is reflected in the products and services provided to its customer. The team works closely with customers, right from the requirement analysis, consultation on application of header compression in wide range of networks, links, products and platforms, design and integration, testing and continued support once the product is rolled out. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Kreab was founded in Sweden in 1970 by Peje Emilsson and Jan-Erik Ander based on a clear-cut business idea - to explain complicated matters in a simple way. This remains the core of what we do. Initially, we focused on public affairs issues and media relations in the Nordic region, later expanding to Brussels. 

Gavin Anderson &amp; Co, which was founded in New York in 1981 by Gavin Anderson, focuses on financial communications in the US, the UK and in Australia. Corporate communications subsequently evolved into an important service. 

Both Kreab and Gavin Anderson continued to expand as two companies with strong service capabilities in corporate communications, financial communications and public affairs issues in their respective markets. In 2009, Kreab and Gavin Anderson merged to create Kreab, a global advisor in strategic communications. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>GES has launched new engagement themes that support the Sustainable Development Goals focusing specifically on companies' management of water and carbon risk. The themes, based on GES and oekom research data, and developed in collaboration with GES clients, enable investors to address their portfolio-based exposure to climate change and water risks within a structured and goal-oriented engagement framework. Investors working with GES on the new thematic engagements include a number of Nordic pension funds and European asset owners and managers. 

GES and oekom research have had a long-standing strategic partnership since 2012 and collaborate on a number of client assignments and services. Hanna Roberts, CEO of GES, says &quot;Many of our clients are looking for specific ways to address climate change and water risks through focused engagement. Our engagement enables them to do this in a concrete and structured way. oekom research's environmental data in particular makes a very solid and consistent basis for our new engagement themes and this collaboration brings together the best of our two organisations&quot;. 

Robert Haßler, CEO of oekom research adds: &quot;We are very much looking forward to add value to and be part of the new GES engagement themes. Our data allow investors a both quantitative and qualitative assessment of a company's climate or water performance. It complements the GES services perfectly and therefore serves as the foundation for their engagement decisions.&quot; 

The engagement follows GES' structured and goal-oriented engagement approach and will run for two years. The engagement and reporting will use measurable metrics and benchmarking to enable a clear assessment of progress and impact of the engagement efforts. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>RxEye, which was founded in 2010 in Sweden, offers a Web-based service where care providers can easily buy and offer their capacity and specific competence for distance reading within radiology. RxEye's Web service handles contracts and quality requirements as well as access to patient information between the involved parties. Doctors have full flexibility through RxEye's service and can read the images irrespective of which hospital or treatment clinic the patient has undergone radiology examination at. 

In Denmark, as in many other European countries, there is a substantial lack of radiologists. The lack of reading radiologists means that image medicine (such as radiology) often constitutes a bottleneck in the healthcare process, involving longer lead times, greater costs and a risk of decline in the quality of care. 

Care providers who have insufficient radiologists or who lack expertise within a specific field can use RxEye to easily and rapidly purchase top quality image diagnostics. RxEye offers the option for the care provider to contract several different organisations for assignments. This allows the care provider to always reach the preferred combination of reading provides who in the best manner can provide for the care givers specific needs for competence and capacity, in both the short and long term. RxEye makes it quick and easy for the care provider to get access to the specialists that it currently lacks. 

&quot;With more than 20 years in the IT &amp; Medical industry, Fineman A/S has acquired considerable expertise and an established client base inDenmark. We are more than excited to partner with RxEye for the sale of their unique and comprehensive solutions inDenmarkand we are confident that this partnership will open new doors for both of us. RxEye fits perfectly together with our intention to help to improve healthcare inDenmarkby using new and effectiveness technology. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Established in 1987, Nyfors Teknologi AB is a Swedish family business that has been a leading developer of optical fiber fusion splicing and recoating systems for more than two decades. 

Among the early users fiber optic communication technology was the Swedish telecommunications industry, with a strong lead from LM Ericsson and the public telephone company Televerket. NYFORS was founded in 1987 by Uwe Böttcher, the former head of Fusion Splicing research and development at LM Ericsson Fiber Optics, to design and manufacture fiber preparation equipment. 

The fiber optical cable between the Swedish mainland and the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea was one of the first major telecommunications projects in which NYFORS participated. This pioneering project was carried out in close collaboration between Televerket and Alcatel, with NYFORS providing the on-board fiber recoaters. 

In 1988, NYFORS launched the first commercial optical fiber recoater in the world. During the 1990's and the 2000's, a number of products used for stripping and preparation, cleaving, recoating and proof testing of optical fiber were developed. Today, our machines and instruments are used for volume production and within research and development operations. Our customers are found within a wide range of industrial sectors, from aerospace and telecom to medicine, as well as public and private research institutions around the world. 

As a pioneering company in the field of fiber optic fusion splicing and with more than twenty years in the business, our mission is to continue to design, develop and manufacture the most innovative equipment available on the market. NYFORS strives to create technological solutions with precision and reliability and to serve all customers with honesty and integrity. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Ledstiernan is a listed private equity company that invests in growth companies with the potential to become global or regional market leaders. Ledstiernan's strategy is to play an active role and to be proactively engaged in the development of these companies, add value and generate growth, with the aim of exiting when the time is ripe. 

Ledstiernan, having been founded as long ago as 1994, has long experience of the venture capital industry. Its shares have been listed on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic Exchange since 2000. 

With the object of actively adding value to its portfolio companies, Ledstiernan has put in place an organisation consisting of experienced personnel possessing broad technical, strategic and financial competence. Ledstiernan can also draw on the strong networks of its board members and its own extensive network of industrial and financial contacts to add value to its portfolio companies. 

Although venture capitalists are by definition exposed to high risks, they also have the potential to earn high returns. The challenge is to pick the right portfolio companies and develop them into real winners. Failures occur, and this is a normal feature of the business. 

Ledstiernan is an active owner; this means that we work in very close co-operation with the founders of and other shareholders in our portfolio companies in order to develop them to their best advantage. Ledstiernan's competence in such areas as technology, finance, strategy and recruitment, combined with our very strong networks in Sweden and abroad, make us well placed to complement the portfolio companies' resources in several key areas. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The Swedish Club has offered Hull &amp; Machinery insurance cover on a mutual basis since 1872. 

The insurance covers the assured's economic interest in the vessel and its equipment and cover is offered for total and partial losses of the insured property. 

The Hull &amp; Machinery insurance also contains an element of cover for liabilities to third parties namely the assured's liability for collisions and often liabilities for a vessel's striking fixed or floating objects. 

This insurance also covers the assured's costs of measures to avert or minimize loss (sue and labour), salvage and general average. The Swedish Club offers insurance on international standard hull conditions such as for example the Nordic Marine Insurance Plan, the English Institute Time Clauses, the American Institute Hull Clauses and the German ADS/DTV Clauses. 

We strive to meet our members' insurance needs and are always willing to discuss specific requirements and tailor-made solutions. 

The Swedish Club has a highly qualified service organisation available to assist our members 24/7. 

We are in favour of good relationships and close cooperation with our members in the claims handling process. This may include onsite assistance by our in-house surveyor and/or technical experts. Claims are generally adjusted by our team of in-house adjusters, which has time and cost benefits both to members and the Club. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Corline® was founded in 1991 by three former employees at the very successful Swedish pharmaceuticals company Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer and GE), with the goal to commercialize an extra corporeal blood pump which at the time was an internal venture at Pharmacia. 

Shortly after inauguration, the company shifted strategic focus from the blood pump system to the blood compatible surface technology, which had been one part of the original project, and develop and offer that as a stand-alone technology to other medical device manufacturers. And thus, the basic CHS™ technology platform and provider strategy was formed. In 1997, Corline® started to supply a large stent manufacturer with CHS™ coated stents, and during 1997-2005 the company delivered more than 100,000 stents coated with CHS™. In 2005, and as a result of research and development made by the company from year 2000 and onwards, another line of business was added to the company's product offering - CHS™ applied to biological products and applications within Regenerative Medicine. Corline's customers can now use CHS™ to immobilize heparin onto living cells and tissue, without compromising their viability. A truly unique product feature in the surface modification market! Today, Corline® successfully offers its unique value proposition to large international customers within its two main segments: Medical Devices and Regenerative Medicine. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Heliospectra AB (publ) (OTCQB: HLSPY, FIRSTNORTH: HELIO) (www.heliospectra.com) specializes in intelligent lighting technology for plant research and greenhouse cultivation. The Company's lighting system provides an effective and durable technology for cultivating greenhouse and indoor plants by combining several different groups of versatile light emitting diodes (LEDs) with optics, remote sensing techniques, and a robust heat dissipation solution. This proprietary setup gives growers the ability to control the intensity and wavelengths of the light emitted, creating a spectrum specifically adjusted to different plant species and growth stages to better facilitate photosynthesis. The complete, highly-engineered lamp produces crops that look better, taste better, and have a longer shelf-life than those grown under HID lamps. The technology not only reduces energy consumption by up to 50 percent, but also helps stimulate growth characteristics and improve plant quality. Other benefits include reduced light pollution, lower mercury use due to the avoidance of traditional HID/HPS bulbs, and less HVAC investment and monthly expense requirements. 

Heliospectra products are based on in-depth knowledge in plant physiology and photosynthesis along with a unique way to utilize modern LED technology. After six years of development in Sweden, the company has now begun to expand into the international market. The company has raised more than $ 21 million in capital and has received more than $2.6 million through academic scholarships and grants. It has also received numerous awards for its forward thinking technology.

         <CompanyDescription>Spoon has a very simple core philosophy - we want our clients' target audience to like everything we do. That might sound a bit trite, but we think it's an approach that's too often absent in the world of communication. 

Ad fatigue is a challenge. People don't want to be interrupted by a commercial that doesn't interest them in the middle of a Sunday night movie. People don't want a newsletter in their inbox that's irrelevant. People don't want to read customer magazines or internal newsletters that only communicate the sender's perspective. 

That's why we at Spoon decided to be different. Just like other agencies we are extremely interested in our clients' business and their strategic objectives. But that's only one side of the coin. The flipside is that everything we do must always be measured against a very basic question: is this something our target audience wants? If the answer is no, then together with our clients we choose a different path. 

Why is this approach so important? Because we believe that consumers are going to be loyal to the brands that respect their time and their interests. The companies that seriously understand that communication now takes place on consumers' terms - or not at all - will be tomorrow's winners. 

The same principle applies to internal communication. Employees will be loyal to an employer that's able to engage them in the key issues facing the company and that develops its corporate communications to do just that. 

We here at Spoon have been talking about Content Marketing since long before it became a buzzword among marketing managers and communication directors. For us the term means that we help our clients create groundbreaking editorial content that builds brands and drives sales, while is at the same time appreciated by audiences. 

We believe that tomorrow's large media players will be brands that are able to create engaging media products based on their expertise. 

We believe that the future belongs to marketing departments that see themselves as media publishers rather than advertising buyers - that want to be the responsible for the content, not the annoying interruption. 

We believe that the future belongs to brands that truly are able to make content that people actually want. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>ClimateWell® was founded in 2001 by two visionaries - Mr. Göran Bolin and Mr. Ray Olsson - with the same revolutionary idea - a thermal heat pump, both economically sustainable and environmentally friendly. The company is deeply indebted to the imagination and entrepreneurship of its founders. 

Mr. Göran Bolin has a long and successful entrepreneurial history in different industries. Decades before the green revolution started, he created Solsam Sunergy, Sweden's largest and best performing solar collector manufacturer up until 2001. 

Mr. Ray Olsson is an innovator and entrepreneur who created SunCool, a company focused on developing Triple-State absorption technology since the mid 1970s. 

ClimateWell® was formed in 2001 from the merger of Solsam Sunergy with SunCool. This brought together the two innovators and gave ClimateWell® its core product: solar-powered air conditioning. Shortly after, brand name consultants, investors and university professors became excited about this innovative technology and offered their full support. 

In 2005 Mr. Per Olofsson was appointed CEO of ClimateWell, bringing global business excellence to the team. He today leads the international expansion. 

In 2008, the construction of the production plant in Olvega, Spain was completed. ClimateWell® started selling its products on the global markets. 

Mr. Göran Bolin won numerous awards for his work and is today Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President of ClimateWell®. He also runs ClimateWell's dynamic product creation team, focused on mass produced heating and cooling components with no CO emissions.

         <CompanyDescription>HolidayPhone was founded based on the belief that everyone should be able to use their phone as usual while traveling, no matter where they are. HolidayPhone's founder, entrepreneur Joacim Boivie, traveled to Thailand and became frustrated with incredibly expensive phone call and mobile data charges while roaming with his home operator. He was convinced that there had to be a better solution that wouldn't cost a fortune - and it turns out he was right! Based on his idea, HolidayPhone started providing local SIM cards for Thailand to travelers from all over the world. Today, HolidayPhone saves money for travelers every day in 30 different destinations! We are very proud to say that, since 2010, more than 100.000 travelers have trusted us to keep them connected abroad. 

Our mission is to provide you with mobile freedom! You should be able to update Facebook from a beach in Thailand, stream music while skiing in the Alps or use your mobile GPS and Yelp to find that amazing restaurant in New York. All without having to worry about coming home to a huge phone bill! 

Our international team is constantly on the lookout for the best deals from telecom operators globally and we pair their offerings with our own Call Forwarding solution. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Treasuremytext is an online SMS Storage service. We've been treasuring SMS messages since 2003. 

How does it work? 

You forward SMS messages by SMS to our standard mobile number based in the United Kingdom. The number works with all GSM based network operators. If your phone uses a SIM card then your operator should be compatible. Once you've signed up for an account, when you login all your forwarded messages should be there. 

How much does it cost? 

It's free, we don't charge you anything for using our service, they're no limits and we don't make any additional charges on the messages you send. We use just regular mobile numbers to keep the cost low. The only charge you receive for using the service is your operator charges for forwarding your SMS to our standard rate mobile number. If you're outside of the UK check with your operator about what they will charge you for international SMS charges and see if they have any deals on international SMS to reduce the cost. 

Who makes Treasuremytext and why? 

Treasuremytext is operated by Kisky Netmedia Ltd. We are based in London, UK. We make Treasuremytext because we think keeping your SMS is an important thing to be able to do. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Crystal Code was founded in 2001 (under another name) originally focusing on web site development. The main business during the last couple of years has been development of iOS Apps. Crystal Code has during these years always been one of the leading iOS development companys in Sweden with several successful projects in the iTunes AppStore. In 2010 Crystal Code decided to expand the business and brought in private equity to finance the expansion. Apart from extra capital for growth the private equity investors are guiding the company through a successful expansion phase and contribute with a solid experience from the application development business. 

To fuel the expansion Crystal Code recruited a large number of mobile system developers from a company working with customized mobile extensions; the extentions was for Line Of Business applications (such as SAP, Peoplesoft, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, etc.). The experience from developing complex mobile LOB (Line of Business) solutions with several thousands of simultaneous users (500 - 4000) adds a systems development dimension to Crystal Code that is not very common among other App development companys in Sweden. Mobile solutions aimed for the corporate LOB market places great demands on competence both during the design- and the development phase. It is crucial that mobile LOB-applications are user friendly, performance optimized, small footprint, can operate with large volumes of data, can operate in an offline environment and make up for a cost effective solution with regards to change requests and reported issues during the maintenance phase. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The background of BrainHeart Capital is very much the background of Ulf Jonströmer and Cynthia Jonströmer - two serial entrepreneurs with Swedish and Japanese origin respectively. 

As a 28-year-old mathematician/economist, Ulf Jonströmer founded AU-System, a software company that focused on large fixed-price projects, and served as its CEO until 2000. The company became the largest specialist in datacom software in Europe, and had a long list the international enterprises as clients. Ulf Jonströmer brought in Ericsson, Telia, and, in the 1990s, Cisco and IBM as co-owners and partners. Two international software product companies, Across Wireless and iD2, were spun out. In 1998, Permira (Europe's largest private equity investor) bought Telia's shares. Two years later, the three companies were divested for a compound value of 2.5 billion dollars - meaning a 100 000 times increase of injected equity. Behind the well-known telecom-internet company Skype, Across Wireless and AU-System are the second- and third-largest exits in venture capital in Northern Europe. 

Ulf was the chairman for the Swedish Software Industry for twelve years. In 1997 Ulf Jonströmer became chairman for the whole Swedish IT/Telecom Industry (including Ericsson, Telia, IBM etc) and left when he entered the financial industry in 2001. Ulf founded BrainHeart Capital AB, which is owned by himself and the CEO, Cynthia Jonströmer. The company established an eight-year-long venture capital fund (USD 200 million) together with an experienced team of individuals from the IT/telecom industry. BrainHeart Capital financed the fund together with the Swedish government, Skandia, IBM and Swiss investors. The BrainHeart Fund became the largest European venture fund dedicated to wireless technology and applications. Among the successful exits are companies like Mobeon, Åkerströms, Meru Networks, Trux and Spring Mobile. 

Before BrainHeart Capital, Cynthia Jonströmer ran her own businesses in Asia within different industries. The largest was a joint venture with the Swedish software company Frontec founded and initially financed by Cynthia. The Frontec Asia operation grew from 3 to over 250 employees in five years, delivering turnkey e-commerce projects. The company provided the solution to build some of the world's largest e-commerce networks. This included Customs 2000 for Chinese government and the Chinese Customs service, COSCO's global network as well as national e-commerce networks for Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Hongkong. 

Upon joining the Frontec management team, Cynthia became the youngest executive vice-president of a listed European company. In 2011 Cynthia became the CEO of BrainHeart Capital - while Ulf Jonströmer took the position as its Chairman. 

2007 BrainHeart started to investigate Cleantech as an investment area. In 2013 this resulted in acquiring a group of companies in the area of rockenergy technologies and services - a renewable energy area where Sweden is in a world lead position with over 6 % of total energy consumption coming from the bedrock/ground. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>On 1 April 2000, ABBA World was launched, after being under development between October 1998 and March 2000.  

ABBA World expanded on ABBALINK, still featuring links to every known ABBA site, but also a lot more: a database of every song recorded or performed by ABBA, a selected discography, ABBA facts, some ABBA-related musings, and a lot more. 

ABBA World received much recognition - FortuneCity selected it as a Featured Site; It's On The Net magazine listed it as their recommended ABBA site, calling it &quot;excellent&quot;; Australian TV current affairs program 60 Minutes linked it when they featured at ABBA story in June 2001 (coincidentally, my other ABBA site was the only other ABBA site linked); and most proudly, it was awarded Most Comprehensive Site 2003 by the Domain of the Diva. 

ABBA World was the first site featured in the ABBA On The Web column in the Official International Agnetha, Benny, Björn, Frida Fan Club Magazine (December 2000). 

At its launch ABBA World had its own domain name www.abbaworld.net, until registration unfortunately lapsed in May 2002 and the domain name was cybersquatted. 

ABBA World was hosted at FortuneCity (at the same address as ABBALINK had been), until 8 September 2003 when it moved to a new host (Server101) and a new domain name, www.abba-world.net. 

ABBA World, version 1 was last updated on 5 February 2004. </CompanyDescription>

• WeSC aims to make and market more organic and sustainable products. In autumn 2008, we launched a small ecological range in 100% organic cotton and we are continuing to develop this line.

• WeSC wishes to encourage the humane treatment of animals, in those cases where animal-based materials are used in our products. We therefore do not use fur and we avoid using Merino wool. 

• WeSCs Code of Conduct, which the company and its retailers, suppliers and wholesalers monitor and work on together, is key. It has been drawn up in line with the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Core International Labour Standards.

         <CompanyDescription>ESAB is a world leader in many areas of the welding and cutting industry and is often benchmarked by its competitors for innovation, product quality and service. We believe that our market position is the result of our customers' appreciation of our total performance and we view our competitors' comparative advertising as an acknowledgement of our strength and market leadership. 

Some of our competitors have adopted the practice of comparing their products to ESAB's products. Due to ESAB's core values of honesty, ethics and integrity, it is not in our culture to conduct aggressive competitor product comparisons and denigration to boost sales. It is well known to welding experts, that test results can be greatly influenced by the test procedures and equipment configurations. 

ESAB's strategy is to focus on our customer needs and to focus our energies and expertise to improve our customers' productivity and competitiveness. It is our firm belief that it is the customers' views and comparisons that really matter as validated by external third parties. 

Through independent research, customers in the welding industry rates ESAB for its excellence in welding consumables customer service, globally. Similar independent research has also shown that ESAB is regarded by customers as their best partner for &quot;undisputed products and services&quot;. 

Visitors to the recent Essen Schweissen &amp; Schneiden welding &amp; cutting show would have directly witnessed ESAB's customer and productivity focus and experienced ESAB's values of openness, care, trust, environmental awareness, quiet confidence and inner strength. 

Unless our customers direct us otherwise, ESAB will continue to avoid public direct competitor product comparisons. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>High Tech High was founded as an equity experiment in social class integration. Working to fulfill the unrealized promise of Brown v. Board of Education, declaring &quot;separate as inherently unequal&quot;, the High Tech High K-12 schools were designed to provide access and challenge to all students within an innovative learning environment. From the design of each school to the design of each learning experience, HTH educators bring a critical equity lens to their work to address historical and systemic oppression affecting disadvantaged students. Through progressive pedagogy focused on deeper learning, students have voice and choice in their learning and an authentic purpose and audience for their work. In turn, students in the GSE examine the connections between equity and design in their practice and develop effective leadership skills to support their colleagues in shaping schools that are both innovative and equitable. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>1887 Trust was formed by alumni, parents, and friends of Gonzaga University. The non-profit organization's purpose is to affirm and support what is admirable in regard to Gonzaga's Catholic identity, while advocating measures to recover and strengthen that identity where it has weakened. 

Having for its membership stakeholders who love Gonzaga, 1887 Trust aims to be a supportive partner - highlighting Gonzaga's Catholic mission and affirming what is best in its history while at the same time bringing to light concerns regarding the trajectory of Gonzaga's Catholic identity. The primary mission of 1887 Trust is to encourage discussion and action to strengthen Gonzaga's Catholic identity in the face of a culture that is arguably becoming more secular. 

As has been well documented, Catholic colleges have not been immune from the general trend of the secularization of academia. Gonzaga University has not entirely escaped this trend. Elsewhere on the site, we detail some of the issues that have given rise to concerns about the strength and the trend line of Gonzaga's Catholicity. 

Speaking generally of the strength of Catholic identity at Catholic universities, Pope Benedict recently stated that &quot;much remains to be done. Still, in regard to Gonzaga, there are many wonderfully Catholic elements present, and it can strengthen its footing if those in governance act steadily to improve the Catholic identity of the school. 

St. Thomas Aquinas defined love as &quot;to will the good of another,&quot; or in other words, to desire for another to succeed. Those involved with the leadership and support of 1887 Trust seek the good of Gonzaga University and its continued success. It is our deeply held conviction that the ultimate flourishing of the university is tied directly to the strength of its commitment to its Catholic founding and continuing Catholic mission. The time is now for alumni and other members of the Gonzaga community to express their support of actions designed to fortify Gonzaga's Catholic identity. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>, Beginning in 1964, Eli Lilly established Conner Prairie with a major donation of land and funds to Earlham College as trustee of a public charitable trust. Earlham agreed to hold Conner Prairie &quot;in trust in perpetuity for the benefit of the public.&quot; Conner Prairie is not &quot;an integral part of Earlham,&quot; as Earlham claims. 

, Under the terms of Mr. Lilly's gifts, only the income on the funds not needed for the operation and development of Conner Prairie could be used for Earlham. Mr. Lilly was very specific in saying that his donations were for Conner Prairie first, and Earlham second.  

, After constructing Prairietown, the Museum center and certain other facilities using Mr. Lilly's gifts, Earlham decided to invest the remaining Lilly funds. The endowment fund was arbitrarily divided 50-50 between the Museum and the College, and Earlham began making periodic distributions from the fund to the Museum, and to itself, in equal amounts. Mr. Lilly never agreed to these procedures, as they were implemented after his death.  

, Earlham realized that the Museum would not be successful without effective management and substantial financial support from the Indianapolis community. To that end, in 1992 it organized Conner Prairie, Inc., appointed prominent Indianapolis-area volunteers to its board and hired professional museum management. But Earlham kept close control over Conner Prairie's finances. However, because of Earlham's control over Conner Prairie, and its endowment management policies, these actions did not achieve their intended goal of attracting community support and funding. In 2001, the College and the board of Conner Prairie began discussing how the operations of the Museum might be further separated from Earlham.  

, These discussions evolved into mediation. But in late 2002, the Earlham board of trustees rejected a mediated agreement and turned the negotiations over to its lawyers.  

, On June 11, 2003, Earlham gave Conner Prairie board representatives a &quot;take- it-or-leave-it&quot; ultimatum that, among other terms, would have permanently established the arbitrary 50-50 split of the Lilly trust funds. That split would have left approximately $65 million allocated to Conner Prairie, but it would have had unrestricted access to only $7 million of that amount. The balance of the &quot;Conner Prairie share&quot; would have stayed under Earlham's management. Earlham College would have been allocated about $75 million, free and clear of the restrictions imposed by Mr. Lilly's gifts.  

, When Conner Prairie's representatives said they could not recommend Earlham's terms to the full board, Earlham dismissed the 27 independent board members and Conner Prairie President John Herbst. The dismissed board members were unpaid volunteers who supported the Museum with contributions of time, expertise and money. Up to the moment of their dismissal, the Conner Prairie representatives were assuring the Earlham representatives of their willingness to continue discussions in good faith, in an attempt to end 25 years of questions and concerns regarding Earlham's management of the endowment funds. At no time did the Conner Prairie representatives threaten Earlham with litigation, as Earlham has claimed. Earlham College immediately issued a press release announcing its actions.  

, The ousted members of the Conner Prairie board formed a not-for-profit organization - Save the Prairie, Inc. - to educate the public about the terms and conditions of Mr. Lilly's gifts, and to seek the independence of Conner Prairie from Earlham.  

, On June 24, 2003, Indiana Attorney General Steve Carter launched an inquiry into Earlham's use of the Lilly funds and its actions as Conner Prairie's trustee. &quot;There have been serious claims brought to my attention about potential misallocation of trust funds that warrants review by this office,&quot; Mr. Carter said. &quot;Our primary focus will be on whether or not charitable donations have been managed and distributed in the manner intended by the donors.&quot; </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Biola University is an excellent Christian institution for your college education, offering 40 undergraduate majors and 145 professional fields of study. While the school classifies us as a 'club' team, the coaching staff is committed to providing you with a varsity experience. Lacrosse at Biola provides you with a unique Christian experience that challenges you academically, spiritually and physically. Biola is highly ranked by U.S. News and World Report among national universities, and Princeton Review named Biola as on the the &quot;Best in the West&quot;. 

What Will My Time Commitment Be for Practices and Games? 

During the fall we practice three times a week on weekdays. During the spring, we practice four times, in addition to weekly games. The minimum fall semester time commitment is six hours, with a minimum 10 hour time commitment in the spring semester. 

How Much Does it Cost to Play Lacrosse at Biola? 

Currently, players are required to pay dues amounting to $500 per season to cover conference and referee fees. Players who are new to the team are required to pay an additional $350 equipment fee, which includes custom gloves, helmet, and a personalized equipment bag. Because we never want a player to be turned away due to financial hardship, we are open to working within an player's budget to accommodate them. 

Does Biola Offer Scholarships or Admissions Assistance? 

As a 'club' program, Biola does not offer lacrosse scholarships, nor is the team able to influence the admissions process. Prospective students should visit undergrad.biola.edu to learn more about the admissions process. 

How Do I Visit Campus?

         <CompanyDescription>For more than forty years, Catholic Theological Union (CTU) at Chicago has been educating and preparing men and women to serve God's people throughout the world. Founded in 1968 in the spirit and vision of the Second Vatican Council, CTU has grown to be the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the United States. 

Since its inception, CTU has been blessed with a rich diversity reflecting the global church itself: a student body representing forty-six countries worldwide; religious order seminarians and lay women and men; students of varying ages and backgrounds. Its distinguished Catholic faculty also includes scholars from the Protestant, Jewish, and Muslim traditions. And over the years CTU's programs have expanded to address the intercultural needs of the Church in an increasingly global society. 

CTU alums now number 3,500, serving the Church across the United States and in sixty-five countries worldwide. They work in parishes, homeless shelters, prisons, hospitals, schools, colleges and universities, gang ministry, hospices, social service organizations, and myriad other ministry settings. 

CTU is also the home of the Bernardin Center of Theology and Ministry, where the ideas and spirituality of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin flourish through scholarships, seminars, lectures, and a full array of programs which focus on Cardinal Bernardin's signature issues, including reconciliation and peacemaking, the consistent ethic of life, youth and young adults, and interreligious dialogue. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>NACA faculty are committed to guiding students to deeply explore specific subject areas, while also being mindful of making connections across these disciplines. 

To do this, teachers create quarterly backward plans that include Enduring Understandings and Essential Questions, formal and summative assessments, cultural connections and specific knowledge and skills that the students will master. Teachers publish and share these plans and receive specific feedback from the Director of Curriculum and Instruction, the Instructional Coordinator, and through Professional Learning Communities, to insure that we have high academic standards and our entire academic program is aligned and integrated. 

At NACA, we believe that to preserve one's language is to preserve one's culture. We also recognize that many colleges require a language component. Therefore, we offer classes in Navajo at both the middle school and high school levels, as well as Dine Government specifically for High School students. We also offer Lakota language classes at the middle school and high school levels, as well as Keres. Students can also take Spanish I, II and III. Read more about NACA's approach in the report Indian Education in New Mexico: 2025, where we were featured as a school using best practices for culturally responsive education. 

In addition to all that students learn in a formal classroom setting, NACA places strong importance on experiential learning through Academic Activities and Learning Trips, Out-of-School Time Learning, and other Special Programs. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Front Sight has made huge steps toward becoming the haven described in this article, it now contains the firing ranges forecasted years ago, and now contains the finest training grounds for any gun user, no matter their level of expertise. As mentioned, Front Sight is a world-class resort. Dr. Ignatius Piazza's goal for Front Sight was to have a place where students can travel to, without needing attention on where to sleep, eat and live while receiving world-class gun training unlike anything on the planet. 

Front Sight is now just that: a world-class resort located very near Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.A.; Front Sight trains more students annually than all other shooting schools in the U.S. combined. Front Sight and Dr. Piazza are empowering students at a breakneck speed, his numbers are continually on the rise, and his students are gaining knowledge at phenomenal paces. 

Front Sight has developed from a small, nearly unheard-of institute to a world-class resort and training haven. Front Sight Firearms Training Institute is regularly attended by men, women, children, celebrities, professionals, police officers, military personnel; active and retired, and people from all other imaginable walks of life. Front Sight is showing to thousands of students every year that, &quot;Any gun will do - if you will do!&quot; </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Jalen was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, where he attended Southwestern High School and the University of Michigan. In college he was part of the legendary &quot;Fab Five&quot; where he and his teammates revolutionized the sport of basketball on the court and off by wearing baggy uniform shorts, black socks and black shoes. The first team in Final Four history to ever start five freshmen, they led the Wolverines to back to back NCAA Championship game appearances. In 1994, Jalen was drafted in the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Notable highlights from his thirteen-year NBA career include winning the NBA's &quot;Most Improved Player&quot; and &quot;Player of the Week&quot; awards in 2000 and &quot;Eastern Conference Player of the Week&quot; accolades in 2005. As a member of the Indiana Pacers, his team appeared in three straight eastern conference finals including a trip to the NBA Finals in 2000. In 2003, he was honored with the Professional Basketball Writers Association Magic Johnson Award. Jalen was inducted into the Detroit High School Hall of Fame in 2013. 

While many basketball stars make the transition to the small screen after they hang up their basketball kicks, Jalen made the bold leap in the midst of his NBA career in 2002, becoming a multi-faceted reporter for BET Mad Sports and an on-air personality for Fox Sports Net's famed Best Damn Sports Show Period. Working with the Best Damn Sports Show Period for six years, the budding broadcast star developed his own lifestyle-oriented &quot;Jammin' With Jalen&quot; segment. Shortly after retiring from basketball in 2007, Jalen - a mass communications major at U of M who ultimately earned his Bachelor of Science from the University of Maryland University College - went full throttle pursuing his passion in the multi-media, sports and entertainment world, signing with ABC/ESPN as an analyst. Covering a wide range of current events in the landscape of sports, he's appeared on the network's flagship shows SportsCenter, Mike and Mike in the Morning, First Take, SportsNation, Outside the Lines and Numbers Never Lie, as well as the basketball related shows Coast to Coast, NBA Tonight and College Game Day. In 2012, Jalen was named a studio analyst for NBA Countdown - ABC and ESPN's pre-game show. 

On September 28, 2015, ESPN Radio launched Jalen &amp; Jacoby, a primetime national weekday program (7 -9 p.m.) co-hosted by Rose and ESPN senior producer/commentatorDavid Jacoby. Jalen &amp; Jacoby, which features Rose and Jacoby breaking down the latest news in sports and pop culture, began as a passion project of the same name in 2011 and was promoted to a full show due to its popularity. On January 28, 2016, Jalen &amp; Jacoby added a TV version of their show on ESPN2 which is comprised of segments from the radio show. Their chemistry, catchphrases and devoted following has led them to have the most downloaded sports podcast (per episode) as well as the most watched sport podcast on the internet. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Brandeis University is a community of scholars and students united by their commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and its transmission from generation to generation. As a research university, Brandeis is dedicated to the advancement of the humanities, arts and social, natural and physical sciences. As a liberal arts college, Brandeis affirms the importance of a broad and critical education in enriching the lives of students and preparing them for full participation in a changing society, capable of promoting their own welfare, yet remaining deeply concerned about the welfare of others. 

In a world of challenging social and technological transformations, Brandeis remains a center of open inquiry and teaching, cherishing its independence from any doctrine or government. It strives to reflect the heterogeneity of the United States and of the world community whose ideas and concerns it shares. In the belief that the most important learning derives from the personal encounter and joint work of teacher and students, Brandeis encourages undergraduates and postgraduates to participate with distinguished faculty in research, scholarship and artistic activities. 

Brandeis was founded in 1948 as a nonsectarian university under the sponsorship of the American Jewish community to embody its highest ethical and cultural values and to express its gratitude to the United States through the traditional Jewish commitment to education. By being a nonsectarian university that welcomes students, teachers and staff of every nationality, religion and orientation, Brandeis renews the American heritage of cultural diversity, equal access to opportunity and freedom of expression. 

The university that carries the name of the justice who stood for the rights of individuals must be distinguished by academic excellence, by truth pursued wherever it may lead and by awareness of the power and responsibilities that come with knowledge. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>&quot;Henley Business School is committed to supporting the development of women through their careers. By offering the Women in Leadership Scholarship with our partners The 30% Club and the Financial Times we feel that we are making great steps towards the goal of increasing Board representation but also helping women overcome the many challenges that hold them back from reaching their full potential at work. 

There are many and varied ongoing challenges faced by women in the workforce. The women who put forward their essays and ideas demonstrate the passion and obvious talent that is out there. Covering issues such as legislation and requiring the publication of Board short-lists to tackling gender stereotyping from early childhood, the essays were thought-provoking and stimulating. 

As the business school in the UK with the highest proportion of female faculty (according to the FT rankings), and close to 1,000 women undertaking programmes from undergraduate to executive education at any point in time, Henley Business School is in a unique position to make a significant contribution and looks forward to further collaboration with The 30% Club.&quot; 

Two runners up Claire Gallery-Strong and Elaine Davis have been awarded a 50% Scholarship on the strength of their applications. 

The Scholarship competition was run in association with the Financial Times and Carola Hoyos, Financial Times Recruitment Editor and Editor of Executive Appointments, was on the judging panel. An awards ceremony was held at Ernst and Young last night.</CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>&quot;VMI is the toughest military institution in the country,&quot; said Anken. &quot;This staff is committed to establishing a brand of lacrosse to reflect the level of physical and mental toughness needed to excel at VMI, as well as in our cadet-athletes impending military duties and civilian life.&quot; 

In his first year on Post, the Keydets captured the first team statistical championship in VMI lacrosse history, beating out NCAA Champion Virginia to lead the nation in ground balls per game with 39.62.Coming out of his second season, Anken once again helped lead the Keydets to the national stats rankings, claiming the team face-off winning percentage of 64.4 (212-329). He also saw Stephen Robarge become the first player to win back-to-back groundballs per game (9.07) titles, as well as the individual face-off percentage (66.6) crown for a second straight season. 

Following his second season in Lexington, Anken helped the Keydets double their win total from 2011, while also collecting his first Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference victory, 9-7 on the road against Manhattan. After a slow start to the season, Anken and the Keydets bounced back, winning four of their last eight games, including three of the last four. Not only did VMI begin winning, but they hung in games as well, including falling by just three combined goals to the two teams that reached the MAAC title game. Anken moved to the offensive side of the ball in 2012, and with solid results. In conference games, the Keydets finished with the program's second-best goals per game average in MAAC tilts, putting away 10.33 per game, the best since 2005 when VMI posted 10.62 a MAAC game. 

After never having a player drafted under Anken's guidance, or any VMI lacrosse player, two Keydets were selected by Major League Lacrosse teams in the same calendar year. In January, 2012, VMI history was made as Robarge became the first VMI player to be drafted by Major League Lacrosse. Robarge was selected in the sixth round and 44thoverall by the Denver Outlaws, one of the top teams in the league. Following the season, Robarge's teammate Keith Long was picked up by the Rochester Rattlers in June in the Supplemental Draft. The pair were two of only three MAAC players to be picked up during the 2011-12 academic year. 

Prior to working at Lycoming, Anken had been the head man at Mars Hill College in North Carolina, where he helped the team post a five and a half game improvement in the standings during his final year, 2006. He earned conference Coach of the Year honors in 2004. He was also the founder and director of the Lions Lacrosse Camp, and handled game and event management as well. 

Anken broke into the coaching ranks with Pfeiffer in 2001, where he was the program's top assistant. There, he was responsible for the defensive side of the ball, along with goalies. He also handled recruiting in Maryland, New York and New Jersey before leaving in 2001 to join the Rochester Institute of Technology, where again, he handled the defense and goalies. During his three years in Rochester, Anken was also an assistant to the school's Athletic Association Director of Development. 

In his career, Anken has coached a pair of NCAA Division III statistical champions. He has also mentored two conference Freshman of the Year and one Player of the Year, and in nine seasons as a head coach, he has had 23 all-conference players and two All-Americans in Stephen Robarge (VMI 2012) and Andrew Chapman (Mars Hill 2006). Anken is a member of the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association's (USILA) Rankings and All-American Committees, as well as being a part of the NCAA Regional Advisory Committee. 

In September 2012, Anken married his wife, Mandy. The couple reside in Lexington. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>About Messiah College: Founded in 1909 by the Brethren in Christ Church, the College's orientation to Christian service is reflected in its first name-Messiah Bible School and Missionary Training Home. Originally located in Harrisburg, the school was moved to Grantham in 1911 following the construction of Old Main. This building is on land donated by the College's first president, Samuel Rogers Smith, whose house and various business interests were in the village of Grantham. Growth in the student body and in facilities accompanied the growth in the academic program. Contributing to the increase in numbers of students was the College's policy, declared in its earliest official statements, of welcoming non-Brethren in Christ people as members of the student body. From a first-year total of 12 students, the student body has grown to nearly 2,900, representing more than 60 denominations. Facilities have also increased from one building-Old Main-to a campus of 471 acres, offering students a breadth of well equipped, high-quality academic, co-curricular, and residential facilities.

         <CompanyDescription>Concordia offers several opportunities for students to take a little time to themselves. One of the ways Concordia has done this is by offering students the opportunity to play in a volleyball club against other colleges. 

Prior to attending Concordia, senior Jordan Goos enjoyed playing volleyball with some of his friends. Since Goos knew he wanted to stay active during college, he decided to look into playing for the club. 

&quot;I knew that I wanted to stay active, but didn't have the time for a varsity sport,&quot; Goos said. &quot;The club enables me to play against other schools but not the full time commitment of a varsity sport.&quot; 

Since Concordia has an all-girl volleyball team, the volleyball club is a way for men to play volleyball. 

Even though the volleyball club team is not a main sport at Concordia, the team is coached by Dr. Cheech and a sophmore volleyball player, Heather Beaner. 

Throughout the school year, the men compete against colleges in the area. According to Goos, when the team is playing against a team nearby, they typically spend the night at Concordia, but when they have to travel far for competitions, they spend the nights at hotels. 

Goos feels that when the team is able to spend the evening in a hotel, the time they are away from campus allows them some quality team bonding time. 

Practices take place Tuesday evenings from 8 p.m. and Thursday evenings from 10 p.m. to 12 p.m. During practices the team spends time honing their skills and scrimmaging against each other. 

Although several individuals sign up to play on the team at the beginning of the year, they tend to skip practice. 

&quot;(Everyone has) different motivations for coming to practice,&quot; Goos said. &quot;Some guys will not come if they're not in the starting six.&quot; 

Since the team is low in numbers, during competitions the men must play in a variety of positions. According to Goos, during their game at Saint Olaf the men had to do this because they were low in numbers. 

&quot;We had people playing the front and back row that normally don't play,&quot; Goos said. &quot;Since we only had six players, we all had to play the whole time.&quot; 

Even though the team had to make some changes to their typical set up, they placed third out of nine teams. 

Sophomore Antonio Burks feels that despite low numbers, when the team does well, it enables them to keep their spirits high. 

&quot;It's nice when you can place in the top five overall,&quot; Bursks said. 

Despite being a club, the outcome for competitions is very positive. According to Burks, when the team has a game several of the men's families come out and watch them compete along with some fellow Convers. 

Although the school year is almost over, Burks encourages students to come out and take part in the team this year to see if it is something they would want to pursue. 

&quot;Even if you are remotely interested, come out and join,&quot; Burks said. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Belhaven College is a contemporary institution built on the timeless principles of service and excellence in higher education. Since its founding, Belhaven College has sought to fulfill the mission expressed in its motto: &quot;non ministrari, sed ministrare&quot; (to serve, not to be served). 

Today's Belhaven is the culmination of three separate institutions of higher learning which merged over the years. Belhaven College was chartered in 1894 in Jackson, Mississippi as a privately-owned institution. In 1911 Belhaven was merged with McComb Female Institute, and in 1939 merged with the Mississippi Synodical College. The founding date of the latter institution, 1883, was adopted by the Board of Trustees as the official founding date of Belhaven College. 

In 1894, Dr. Lewis Fitzhugh established Belhaven College for Young Ladies on Boyd Street at the former residence of Colonel Jones S. Hamilton. The College took the name of the house, Belhaven in honor of Hamilton's ancestral home in Scotland. A fire destroyed the main building in February, 1895, but with the help of Jackson citizens the College reopened in the fall of 1896 at the same site. 

Fitzhugh served as president until his death in 1904, upon which his heirs sold the College to Dr. J. R. Preston. He operated Belhaven until it was again destroyed by a fire in 1910, then he donated the title of the College to the Presbyterian Church. In September, 1911 the school was reopened by the Central Mississippi Presbytery as Belhaven Collegiate and Industrial Institute, at a new site on Peachtree Street. Dr. R. V. Lancaster of McComb Female Institute became the third president as the two institutions merged. In 1915 the Board of Trustees changed the school's name to Belhaven College. During these years improved curricula guidelines and student services were established. Dr. W. H. Frazier succeeded Lancaster as president from 1918-21, and during his tenure enrollment grew to 230 students. 

In 1921 the Reverend Guy T. Gillespie of Lexington, Mississippi, began a presidency that would last 33 years. In Gillespie's tenure Belhaven was first accredited, an endowment fund begun, and scholarship aid made available. Through depression, war, and unstable economic times Belhaven maintained its mission. 

Dr. McFerran Crowe succeeded Gillespie in 1954 and over six years he expanded and upgraded the faculty, while modernizing business operations. It was also in 1954 that the Board of Trustees voted to make Belhaven fully co educational, thus ensuring continued growth. In 1960-61, Dr. Robert F. Cooper served as acting president until the Board selected Dr. Howard J. Cleland. An ambitious expansion program resulted in six major new buildings, while enrollment and the College budget tripled during Cleland's 17-year tenure. Another significant change came in 1972, when the Synod of Mississippi transferred ownership of the College to the Board of Trustees. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>CalArts is implementing a new campus alert system that uses current cell phone, voice mail and texting technology to inform the community in case of an emergency. The system is provided by Connect-ED, which is used by the major school districts in the Santa Clarita Valley. This system allows (1) emergency notification via cell phone, text, voice mail or email systems; (2) student/staff/faculty notification on up to four phone numbers and two email addresses; and (3) messages to be sent either from campus as well as remote locations. 

Student numbers/emails were collected during registration in January. Staff and faculty information is currently being assembled. Once all of the information is collected and vetted we will be sending it on to Connect-ED for implementation. We are hoping to test this new system in coordination with this semester's fire drill. 

It is important that CalArts maintain its unique creative environment, while recognizing that outside forces must be addressed with a consistent and well defined safety plan. It is our hope that these and future changes will add to the Institute's overall safety and preparedness. 

Issues of living successfully with our own diversity have occupied many of the councils of the Institute for the past two years, and were the subject of our Town Hall meeting in the fall. Already, more attention to these issues has been built into new student orientation and I think we can expect this component to grow over the next years. There is, I believe, a growing attention to issues of diversity in the hiring of faculty, which is reflected in a number of critical appointments over the past two years. I hope you all saw the announcement that went our last week that a new personal counselor on the Student Affairs staff, Melissa Shephard, has experience in offering workshops in multiculturalism. Right now, a job description for a new position as assistant provost for equity and diversity is working its way through the Dean's Council and the Academic Council. The holder of this position will be the point person in an Institute-wide effort to: (1) encourage greater student, faculty and staff understanding; (2) to encourage sensitivity toward differences in cultural, ethnic, religious and sexual background and orientation; and (3) to develop policies and programs that help prepare CalArts students to live and act respectfully in a complex and diverse world, and to take advantage of their own distinctive talents and resources in making their art. 

That's a mouthful. What it comes down to is that this person's job will be to wake up each day ready to work with all the councils of the Institute in developing policies and procedures, as well as in facilitating workshops and helping to strengthen attention to diversity in life and education at CalArts. 

Having said all this, I must also say that the pressures on next year's budget are extraordinary, in part because the Board approved the smallest percentage increase in tuition in a decade (from $31,290 to $32,860, or 5%). Right now in planning the budget a salary line has been included but we don't know yet where this process will end. We may have to wait until midyear to hire someone, but I hope not. 

Finally, I want to turn to this issue of mentoring and academic counseling. The student mentor relationship has, at its best, been one of the glories of CalArts, but right now the strength of mentoring varies considerably from school to school and department to department. Moreover, traditionally this relationship has been focused on the student's individual artmaking, which is as it should be. Yet students also require counseling about requirements, about what best to take outside their own school, and about a host of other issues. We don't yet have a solution for moving forward, but we must develop one, to ensure that every student has the optimal opportunity to make it through to graduation. One step we have taken is to develop an At-risk Students Committee, under Associate Provost John Bache, designed to identify any student who seems at risk academically, behaviorally, or in any other way, and then to offer appropriate counseling. This is a critical safety net but at the other end of the scale, we must do everything possible to ensure that every student is able to take the best possible advantage of CalArts. That's a challenge this year, and will be every year; and so here is, perhaps, where I should stop to take questions or comments. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Now that Pinterest offers business accounts, some of my clients wonder how to move their more &quot;business&quot; pins from their personal accounts to their new business accounts. These are pinners who are happy to have two accounts and don't want to share all of their personal boards, full of everything they've pinned over the past year, with the people they know through business. 

Moving pins is easy. 

Another word for &quot;moving pins&quot; is &quot;repin. It's just that it happens between accounts you own. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Presbyterian College is a highly selective, private liberal arts college in Clinton, South Carolina, USA. Presbyterian College, or PC, is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church USA. PC was founded in 1880 by William Plumer Jacobs, a prominent Presbyterian minister who also founded the nearby Thornwell Home and School for Boys and Girls. The college's current President is Dr. John V. Griffith. 

Presbyterian College has around 1300 students and runs on an endowment of around $100 million. PC also has 84 full-time faculty members. Over the years six of its faculty have been selected as South Carolina Professors of the Year, more than any other college or university in the state. 

The motto of PC is &quot;Dum Vivimus Servimus&quot; or &quot;While We Live We Serve. Service is a crucial part of PC, and almost all of its students partake in some form of service by the time they graduate. Consequently, students are encouraged to participate in programs like Student Volunteer Services, one of the largest student-run organizations on campus. 

What others say about PC:


The Washington Monthly in 2009 ranked PC number one for encouraging students to give something back to their communities and No. 26 among all liberal arts colleges and universities in the United States. For the second year in a row, Presbyterian College has been named a Best Buy School in the Fiske Guide to Colleges. PC is one of only 49 colleges and universities in the country to receive the distinction. 

The John Templeton Foundation recognizes PC as a character-building college that educates the whole person, not just the intellect. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The University of Virginia will unveil its new world-class squash facility on Sept. 19, and the sport's elite ranks have begun lining up to offer their seals of approval. 

The $12.4 million McArthur Squash Center at the Boar's Head Sports Club opened its doors in April, but the 33,000-square-foot venue will mark its formal debut with a Grand Opening Festival of Squash, to be held Sept. 19 through 22. A ribbon-cutting ceremony and presentations by University officials and the center's primary donor, Jaffray Woodriff, will launch the festival. 

The event will include five simultaneous professional and amateur tournaments, highlighting the state-of-the-art facility's draw as both a spectator venue for elite-level competition and as a magnet for squash players of all levels. 

The squash facility is operated for U.Va. by the Boar's Head resort, a subsidiary of the University of Virginia Foundation. 

&quot;The McArthur Squash Center has clearly exceeded our expectations, in terms of its beauty and its function, its layout and how it's going to attract people to the game of squash,&quot; said Tim Rose, CEO of the University of Virginia Foundation. &quot;I told my staff when they were working on it, 'Many people will go through life and never have the opportunity to work on something that's considered the best in the world.

         <CompanyDescription>Meanwhile, a group of researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle is offering an alternative to wireless data transmission that could make medical devices and wearables more secure: transmitting the data through our bodies rather than broadcasting them over the air. Their premise is that it's much harder to surveil a human body without someone noticing than it is to surreptitiously pluck a password from wireless signals in the air. 

In tests with 10 subjects, the group showed that it's possible to transmit passwords at speeds of up to 50 bits per second (bps) through the human body, using off-the-shelf products such as fingerprint scanners and iPhone fingerprint sensors. For comparison, a standard Internet package in the U.S. offers download speeds of 15 megabits-per-second, or 15 million bits per second. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>In the early 1970's the Australian Government asked the University of New South Wales to establish a national world-class business school, the Australian Graduate School of Management (AGSM), to enhance the effectiveness of Australian management on a national level, then and into the future. The AGSM MBA and AGSM Executive Programs were launched in 1977. Thirty years later, the AGSM MBA is ranked in numerous surveys as a top 50 MBA program internationally and as Australia's most coveted MBA. During that time, AGSM Executive Programs has been the consistent leader in Australia and one of the leaders in executive education in the Asia Pacific region. In 1999, UNSW and the University of Sydney merged AGSM with Sydney's Graduate School of Business. This partnership lasted for six years prior to its dissolution in 2006, at which time AGSM returned organisationally to its traditional home at UNSW. The dissolution of the joint venture provided the incoming Vice-Chancellor, Professor Fred Hilmer, with the opportunity to pool the complementary strengths of AGSM and UNSW's Faculty of Commerce and Economics into an integrated comprehensive business school, which would leverage its capabilities across undergraduate programs, MBA programs, specialist masters degrees, executive education and research. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Dillard University is among the list of 33 historically black colleges and universities to which undergraduates can apply with one application for a one-time fee of $35. 

Clark Atlanta University is the most recent addition to the list of schools using the Black College Common Application, started in 1998 by EDU Inc. President Robert Mason to increase the marketing and recruitment efforts of HBCUs nationally. In one step, Mason said, the EDU application allows a prospective student to receive acceptance letters, financial aid packages and scholarship offers to several different colleges. 

EDU recruiters, based in Atlanta, visit 3,000 high schools a year on average, representing its member institutions and getting more students to compete the application. To date, the company says more than 75,000 students have used the EDU application. 

Although now well-known, national and state-specific or group applications such as the Common Application and the Universal Common Application have been around for more than three decades. 

The Common Application, started in 1975, represents 346 institutions, including Harvard and Princeton universities and HBCUs such as Morehouse, Spelman and Xavier University. The Universal College Application, started in 2007, has 78 large public Ivy League institutions. The Black College Common Application is the first to serve only HBCUs. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Lewis &amp; Clark College, a private liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon, was founded in 1867 as Albany Collegiate Institute by a group of Presbyterian pioneers in the Willamette Valley town of Albany 46 miles south of Portland. The College has always been coeducational, from the first class, which graduated in 1873. By 1938 enrollment in Portland had outgrown that on the original campus, and all operations were moved to Portland. In 1942 the College trustees acquired the Lloyd Frank (of the historic Portland department store Meier &amp; Frank) &quot;Fir Acres&quot; estate in southwest Portland, and adopted the name Lewis &amp; Clark College as a &quot;symbol of the pioneering spirit that had made and maintained the College. Today, the three schools of the College and their supporting offices occupy a campus of 137 acres (554,000 m²), centered on the Frank estate on Palatine Hill in Southwest Portland. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The Hebrew Language Academy Charter School (&quot;HLA&quot;) is a dual language public elementary school located in Brooklyn, New York. Founded in 2009, HLA's mission is to provide a nurturing yet rigorous dual language program committed to fostering academic excellence and a high degree of Hebrew language proficiency. Our school provides students with a sophisticated core curriculum in English Language Arts, mathematics, the sciences, social studies, art, music, technology and physical education. We incorporate Hebrew language instruction across the curriculum through a partial immersion proficiency model. 

At HLA, we recognize that our students are growing up in an increasingly &quot;global&quot; community. Our entire educational program is geared towards providing students with a solid foundation to become ethical, productive citizens in this global community. We help our students learn social and civic responsibility through the integration of community service and service learning into their classroom studies, and diversity, tolerance and openness are emphasized throughout the curriculum and school life. 

HLA currently serves 475 K-5 students. The school plans to add a grade level each school year until it ultimately serves grades K to 8 in the 2017-2018 school year. HLA's student population reflects the diversity of our surrounding community in Brooklyn, New York. Most of our students come from families with at least one foreign-born parent, and a majority comes from homes where languages other than English are spoken at home (Russian, Hebrew, Creole, Spanish, among others). In addition, more than half of our students are eligible for free or reduced lunch. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The CSU nursing program provides a seamless program with Trident Technical College to educate ADN nurses at the BSN level. Muriel Horton, dean of nursing at Trident, said, &quot;We are delighted that the graduates of our associate degree nursing program have a local barrier-free option for completing their BSNs. Thanks to Dr. Hulsey's visionary leadership and her commitment to educating nurses, students who may not have otherwise obtained a BSN now have that opportunity. CSU also offers a master of science in nursing program with a nurse educator track. &quot;This has already proved to be a major benefit for us as we have had the privilege of hiring several of CSU's graduates,&quot; said Horton. 

Tanya Lott, a 1999 CSU BSN alum, is the coordinator of Roper St. Francis's magnet program. Only six percent of U.S. hospitals have achieved magnet status. Lott said, &quot;CSU provided me with the education, nurturing and leadership development I needed to begin a career in nursing that has been filled with so many wonderful opportunities. I am so thankful that my nursing roots were formed here. The growth of the program means that there will be more CSU graduate nurses available to deliver exceptional care to the people of the Lowcountry and beyond.&quot; 

A touching end to the program was a Blessing of the Hands ceremony performed by the Baptist Nursing Fellowship, a Christian professional fellowship for nurses, healthcare professionals and nursing students. Sophomore nursing students, affectionately called &quot;newbies,&quot; participated in a litany of affirmation led by Becka Moore, BNF executive director for South Carolina. BNF members symbolically washed the student nurses' hands and spoke a prayer over them. 

The Charleston Southern bachelor of science in nursing program has a 95 percent seven-year average pass rate on the national exam required to receive a license to practice (NCLEX). Charleston Southern has the highest seven-year pass rate of all accredited BSN programs in the state of South Carolina. 

The Charleston Southern nursing program is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, the largest and oldest accrediting agency for nursing, and is a member of the National League for Nursing and the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The closest approximation to a true industry-wide standard is the act of accreditation by a regional accrediting association - and CfA is both accredited through the nation's oldest such accreditor, NEASC, and also was the first competency-based degree program in the nation approved for federal student aid by the US Department of Education. In sum, we are confident that our students at CfA learn and demonstrate mastery of writing that exceeds a typical traditional associate's degree. 

Finally, let's add one layer beyond academics:


(3) Is the CfA assessment sufficiently rigorous for an employer's expectations of an associate's degree holder? 

We launched College for America to be much more than a degree program - we believe it is a critical and innovative ingredient in solving the massive skills gap facing American employers. So when we look at holding ourselves accountable, it's not enough to achieve more rigor than an existing traditional school - we also need to ensure we are meeting employers needs and expectations as well. 

The real test here is: can an employer be confident that Zach Sherman (our first graduate) or others like him can write at the level needed on a job that requires an associate's degree? According to our Chief Workforce Strategist, Julian Alssid, who has been studying and working on the workforce skills gap issues for stakeholders like the Ford Foundation, US Department of Labor, and more than 20 U.S. States over the past two decades, the answer is resoundingly yes. Here's why:


At the heart of the skills gap is a disconnect between educators and employers. Consider the recent McKinsey Education to Employment study of 8,000 employers and education providers, which found that 72% of educators believe their graduates are ready for work, while only 42% of employers believed the same. 

At CfA we are taking this head-on, continually analyzing our curriculum against skills or work tasks that can be found across multiple occupations to ensure relevancy in the workplace. For example, we recently reviewed and compared our curriculum to the skills required for 17 specific in-demand associate's degree-level job titles. In this process, we identified numerous writing skills that are common to both our curriculum and these jobs (for example: developing sales or informational presentations or speeches; preparing technical or financial reports; etc.). Integral to our curriculum development process is ongoing discussion with employers to ensure our students are prepared both academically and for changing industry skill requirements. 

A 2013 survey of employers for the Association of American Colleges and Universities also provides insight that supports the CfA approach, including our (1) above-average writing requirements, (2) project-based learning and skills development, and (3) portfolio-based transcripts:


&quot;More than three in four employers say they want colleges to place more emphasis on helping students develop five key learning outcomes, including: critical thinking, complex problem-solving, written and oral communication, and applied knowledge in real-world settings . . . 

Across many areas tested, employers strongly endorse educational practices that involve students in active, effortful work . . .they also strongly endorse practices that require students to demonstrate both acquisition of knowledge and its application . . . 

In addition to a resume or college transcript, more than four in five employers say an electronic portfolio would be useful to them in ensuring that job applicants have the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in their company or organization.&quot; 

In conclusion (and perhaps not surprisingly!) we are confident that the CfA degree's requirements regarding mastery of written communication compare favorably with both a traditional associate's degree in General Studies, and with employer's expectations of the same. 

Finally, we've devoted this blog post to discussing just one of the three pillars of our program - accountability. Our goal here is to build a degree in which the student and school are both more accountable for the resulting student competencies than the traditional higher ed model. But it's worth remembering that there are also two other pillars. We are making a program that is more accessible for working, adult learners than the traditional school (through project-based, self-paced work where time is flexible but mastery is mandatory). And, we have built a radically affordable degree program. At $2,500/year, the CfA degree is literally one tenth the cost of some other associate's degree programs. The result is bringing Zach Sherman - and thousands more like him - the benefit of a high-quality college degree that otherwise would have passed them by.

         <CompanyDescription>UW-Stout's Technology and Business Incubator fosters technical businesses through close relationships with faculty, students, industry, and the UW-Stout community to better enable Wisconsin to compete in the global economy and sustain employment within the region. New businesses receive affordable facilities, services, and professional support in areas that include marketing, packaging, product development, and plant layout. Some start-up costs are deferred until graduation. The UW-Stout incubator eases the way into the private sector to promote further economic development in west central Wisconsin. The incubator has created over 100 new jobs in the region with over 70% of the incubator clients operating successful businesses today. Data collected in a survey of (current and former) incubator clients reported 393 employees, over $73 million in annual sales, and an excess of $15 million in investments. This unusually high success rate for start-up businesses is due in part to the quality of services provided by the incubator staff and the numerous resources provided by UW-Stout students and faculty. Criteria for acceptance into the incubator also helps ensure the success of new businesses. Incubator staff members work closely with students, faculty, and the Center for Innovation and Development (CID) -- another Stout Technology Transfer Institute center. UW-Stout is currently the most active campus in invention disclosures, according to the WiSys Technology Foundation, with 35 disclosures from June 2000 through June 2009.

         <CompanyDescription>The Hunter College Campus Schools consist of an elementary school (kindergarten to sixth grade) and a high school (seventh to twelfth grades) with enrollments of 336 and 1200 students, respectively. The schools are publicly funded, chartered by the board of Trustees of the City University of New York, and administered by Hunter College. They are coeducational laboratory schools for students who exhibit superior cognitive ability and are organized as research and demonstration centers. The schools are committed to serving a gifted student body and do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin or disability. The elementary program admits students from Manhattan only whereas the high school admits students from each of the five boroughs of the City of New York. The schools recognize that gifted students need an atmosphere of freedom in order to meet their own challenges and those presented to them, and a curriculum that emphasizes critical and creative thinking and mastery of the spectrum of the arts and sciences. They also require the vital stimulation of a strong program in physical education, and support for sound emotional development. 

The schools aspire to be a community in which students come to respect and to appreciate diversity in an environment that fosters social responsibility, ethical behavior, civility, and sensitivity toward others. Hunter students, as gifted and talented youngsters, tend to be mature for their age, self-motivated, independent, and inventive. They often have artistic and creative talents in addition to their strengths in academic areas. Critical thinking is also a common characteristic. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>Wakefield School integrates technology to support student learning. 

Our goal is for technology to transparently support our students, faculty, staff, and coaches in developing themselves to their fullest potential. Technology encourages communication among parents, students, and faculty, and we believe technology harnessed to a rigorous and content-rich curriculum will help our students to lead extraordinary lives. 

Wakefield School became the first Google Education school in Northern Virginia in 2009. We made a commitment to cloud computing and 21st century education with this endeavor. We established Wakefield School email addresses for all of our students in grades 5-12 and are integrating Google Applications into safe and guided collaboration and sharing within our community. Our students and faculty are now connected to each other whenever and wherever they are accessing the Internet through Google Applications and Documents. 

Our parents and students are connected to their teachers through the use of NetClassroom which allows parents to monitor student assignments and grades in real time. Assignment grades are reported as they are entered into the teacher's electronic grade book. The grade books of all of our teachers in grades 4-12 are reported in Net Classroom. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>In October 2005, ANEI received a fifteen-month, $100,000 grant from the USDA to develop and implement a recycling-based, integrated, solid-waste, management program for Sullivan County, New Hampshire. ANEI is the nonprofit, community-consulting arm of Antioch University New England based in Keene, NH. ANEI's grant is complemented by a two-year, $90,000 grant that RCAP Solutions received from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to improve solid- waste disposal in Sullivan County, NH.  

Under the grant, ANEI will develop a long-term, recycling-based, integrated, waste-management program and implement select, innovative, pilot programs to field test their feasibility. This approach will help ensure that Sullivan County towns have realistic projections of how much waste can be diverted and experience implementing these cost-effective programs. The recycling-based, integrated, waste-management plan will emphasize reducing the volume and toxicity of waste through recycling, waste reduction, reuse, composting, proper management of household, hazardous waste and residuals. The plan will explore economic-development opportunities that promote partnerships in managing waste across the public/private divide. The plan will strive to maximize job-creation opportunities through collection, processing, and re-manufacturing of recyclable and compostable materials.  

If you have questions or concerns regarding the Sullivan County, Solid-Waste, Management Program you can contact its Project Director, Jim Gruber, at (603) 283-2105, ext. 336.

Advancement goals at the institutional level include increasing the college's endowment by $10,000,000 (for student scholarships, faculty research and development, academic program enrichment, and library acquisitions), construction of a 3,000 seat auditorium, a community services/student union center, and a Center for Information Technology, and renovation of historical buildings on campus. 

Fulfillment of these goals requires an emphasis on support from alumni, individual donors and others in the private sector. With the aid of the Kresge Foundation grant, Bethune-Cookman College will have the training and support essential for the enhancement of fundraising programs aimed at this important group of donors.

         <CompanyDescription>Drury began in 1873. It was organized by Congregational home missionaries who felt the need for an academically strong liberal arts college in the area. Patterned after the Congregationalist liberal-arts colleges of the North, such as Oberlin, Carleton, Dartmouth, Yale and Harvard, the college would offer an environment of strong academic discourse and intellectual achievement. Today, Drury University offers more than 70 majors and academic programs. But a quality education goes beyond the standards of academic scholarship. Drury enriches the whole person as each student explores new ideas, challenges beliefs, learns to think critically and eventually finds new ways to understand the world outside the classroom.

         <CompanyDescription>WitchSchool.com is the first truly online school dedicated to Wiccan, Pagan, and magical thought! We founded Witch School because we found that many people who wanted to learn about Wicca were unable to find good information or training, either because they were geographically isolated or because they simply could not find real-time teachers. Some of these people were seeking to make Wicca their spiritual path, others just wanted to learn more about what Wicca really is. 

We wanted to share our knowledge with all who genuinely wish to learn -because we believe that spiritual knowledge makes for a better, well-rounded person, and better people make for a better world. We made a commitment teach all who wanted to learn and to do so at little or no cost. This commitment to teach is renewed daily by everyone involved. The majority of our members study free of charge, and even our Supporting Memberships have only a minimal cost. </CompanyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>The Swedish Institute's company vision is to be recognized as a premier multispecialty allied health educational institution, using its 100-year tradition of excellence in the education of massage therapists to inform education and training in diverse areas of allied health education and practice. Its students will benefit from health care programs that are based on a holistic and integrative approach to health and wellness and yet meet or exceed the rigorous requirements of programmatic accreditation, including high graduate pass rates on licensure and certification exams. Faculty and staff will shape an inclusive learning environment where students experience the best in teaching practices and the support and guidance needed to succeed in the classroom and on the job. 

The past 15 years have seen the institute grow from a well-known school of massage therapy offering a 692 clock-hour certificate program into a multi-purpose institution with authority from the New York State Education Department to grant degrees at the associate, baccalaureate and master's levels. The college continues to offer its long-standing program in massage therapy and has since added degree programs in advanced personal training, medical assistant and surgical technologist, and an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree in nursing.

         <CompanyDescription>The Mission of MIT Collaborative Initiatives is to promote a systems-based approach to solving deep-rooted societal issues by engaging experts from a broad range of disciplines both within and outside the scope of a problem. 

It is the belief of the Collaborative that many of today's most challenging issues can benefit from outside expertise. Debate among experts is valuable but is often self-perpetuating. Adding viewpoints from outside the conversation broadens the debate and may lead it in new directions. The Collaborative's intentions are not to compete with people and organizations involved in addressing critical issues, but to swell the wave by broadening the discussion. 

In addition, the Collaborative has come to believe that a systems-based approach is vital to challenging widespread societal issues. Systems thinking looks at the interconnectivity of actions and studies a problem as a whole. This approach considers the system as a sum of its parts where a change in any one part has system-wide ramifications. Without this global view much time can be spent addressing issues in a single part of what is ultimately a comprehensively flawed system. 

The Collaborative applies its Mission in two basic models:


We bring people together to instigate challenging discussion and debate around a given issue or set of issues. 

Often, the Collaborative is approached to bring a significant group together around a specific topic and facilitate constructive dialogue. At other times, the Collaborative identifies areas that it feels could benefit from this type of broad discussion and initiates the meetings. 

Meetings range in size and scope, and the Collaborative takes on large group meetings-in a discussion format-if it feels that a broad discussion across silos and with outside input could be beneficial. The Collaborative is currently focused on healthcare, but has facilitated these types of meetings around issues in global health, global finance, and other areas of widespread concern. We target specific areas of interest and develop projects by identifying and advising a project team, engaging influential external advisors, and building project objectives to apply a systems approach to various arenas. 

The ultimate goal of MIT Collaborative Initiatives is to shrink the existing gap between the way we think and what the world actually needs, and to encourage and develop innovative solutions to the enormous challenges that we as a society face in the beginning of the 21st Century. </CompanyDescription>

August 2005, Professor Jung-Hoon Chun and Dr. David Brock visited the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to discuss the goals and objectives of the MIT Data Center in the area of the building of an interoperable computer system to link models and data together within a network. NIST recognizes that this type of basic infrastructure has important implications to business in terms of manufacturing productivity and improved integration of data and mathematical models. 

At the conclusion of the meeting, NIST agreed to formalize a collaborative agreement with the MIT Data Center, the goal being further research, development, and implementation of the M Language and Dictionary. This will include frequent consultations and participation in the various programs of the MIT Data Center, in addition to a program for graduate students doing thesis work in the area. 

NIST is an agency located within the Commerce Department's Technology administration. The agency has participated in a number of technological innovations since its establishment in 1901. These include image processing, DNA diagnostic chips, smoke detectors, and automated error-correcting software for machine tools. The agency conducts a number of research programs including the Information Technology Laboratory.

         <CompanyDescription>The MIT Global Startup Workshop (MIT GSW) was founded in 1997 when the MIT $50K (now $100K) Entrepreneurship Competition received numerous queries from around the world from organizations interested in starting and improving their own business plan competitions (BPCs). The first MIT GSW was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts in March 1998 and brought together an international community committed to launching BPCs to stimulate and nurture entrepreneurship worldwide. 

A decade later, having helped grow and mature the BPC community, in 2007 the MIT GSW expanded its mission to include all aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Today we continue to build stronger, more productive entrepreneurial ecosystems around the world and a diverse and dynamic global support network for entrepreneurs. 

The MIT GSW has been held on six continents (except Antarctica!), reached participants from over 70 nations, and grown to become the premier workshop for fostering global entrepreneurship. Our participants have founded BPCs, entrepreneurial support organizations, educational programs, and new startups, while gaining invaluable contacts and forging lasting relationships.

         <CompanyDescription>Global MITS was founded in 2007. While serving as the IT Manager of a large Semi-Conductor Equipment Manufacturing company in the Greater Boston Area, the current Owner was approached by a group of people who had just started a Bio-Med company. He was asked to set up and maintain an inexpensive yet reliable network. After working with them and maintaining their network for several years, he realized that small to medium sized companies needed to have inexpensive, reliable 24/7 IT solutions, and so he began building the business on that principal. In 2010 he partnered with a group that excelled in remote monitoring and help desk services. By joining forces Global MITS now had the ability to provide full service solutions to the SMB market at competitive prices. 

Global MITS can design, build or rework your current network and stay in line with your company budget. We strive to provide you with the best solution at the lowest cost. We won't sell you products or services you don't need or want.

         <companyDescription>The Mission of MIT Collaborative Initiatives is to promote a systems-based approach to solving deep-rooted societal issues by engaging experts from a broad range of disciplines both within and outside the scope of a problem. 

It is the belief of the Collaborative that many of today's most challenging issues can benefit from outside expertise. Debate among experts is valuable but is often self-perpetuating. Adding viewpoints from outside the conversation broadens the debate and may lead it in new directions. The Collaborative's intentions are not to compete with people and organizations involved in addressing critical issues, but to swell the wave by broadening the discussion. 

In addition, the Collaborative has come to believe that a systems-based approach is vital to challenging widespread societal issues. Systems thinking looks at the interconnectivity of actions and studies a problem as a whole. This approach considers the system as a sum of its parts where a change in any one part has system-wide ramifications. Without this global view much time can be spent addressing issues in a single part of what is ultimately a comprehensively flawed system. 

The Collaborative applies its Mission in two basic models:


We bring people together to instigate challenging discussion and debate around a given issue or set of issues. 

Often, the Collaborative is approached to bring a significant group together around a specific topic and facilitate constructive dialogue. At other times, the Collaborative identifies areas that it feels could benefit from this type of broad discussion and initiates the meetings. 

Meetings range in size and scope, and the Collaborative takes on large group meetings-in a discussion format-if it feels that a broad discussion across silos and with outside input could be beneficial. The Collaborative is currently focused on healthcare, but has facilitated these types of meetings around issues in global health, global finance, and other areas of widespread concern. We target specific areas of interest and develop projects by identifying and advising a project team, engaging influential external advisors, and building project objectives to apply a systems approach to various arenas. 

The ultimate goal of MIT Collaborative Initiatives is to shrink the existing gap between the way we think and what the world actually needs, and to encourage and develop innovative solutions to the enormous challenges that we as a society face in the beginning of the 21st Century. </companyDescription>

August 2005, Professor Jung-Hoon Chun and Dr. David Brock visited the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to discuss the goals and objectives of the MIT Data Center in the area of the building of an interoperable computer system to link models and data together within a network. NIST recognizes that this type of basic infrastructure has important implications to business in terms of manufacturing productivity and improved integration of data and mathematical models. 

At the conclusion of the meeting, NIST agreed to formalize a collaborative agreement with the MIT Data Center, the goal being further research, development, and implementation of the M Language and Dictionary. This will include frequent consultations and participation in the various programs of the MIT Data Center, in addition to a program for graduate students doing thesis work in the area. 

NIST is an agency located within the Commerce Department's Technology administration. The agency has participated in a number of technological innovations since its establishment in 1901. These include image processing, DNA diagnostic chips, smoke detectors, and automated error-correcting software for machine tools. The agency conducts a number of research programs including the Information Technology Laboratory.

         <companyDescription>The MIT Global Startup Workshop (MIT GSW) was founded in 1997 when the MIT $50K (now $100K) Entrepreneurship Competition received numerous queries from around the world from organizations interested in starting and improving their own business plan competitions (BPCs). The first MIT GSW was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts in March 1998 and brought together an international community committed to launching BPCs to stimulate and nurture entrepreneurship worldwide. 

A decade later, having helped grow and mature the BPC community, in 2007 the MIT GSW expanded its mission to include all aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Today we continue to build stronger, more productive entrepreneurial ecosystems around the world and a diverse and dynamic global support network for entrepreneurs. 

The MIT GSW has been held on six continents (except Antarctica!), reached participants from over 70 nations, and grown to become the premier workshop for fostering global entrepreneurship. Our participants have founded BPCs, entrepreneurial support organizations, educational programs, and new startups, while gaining invaluable contacts and forging lasting relationships.

After working with them and maintaining their network for several years, he realized that small to medium sized companies needed to have inexpensive, reliable 24/7 IT solutions, and so he began building the business on that principal. In 2010 he partnered with a group that excelled in remote monitoring and help desk services. By joining forces Global MITS now had the ability to provide full service solutions to the SMB market at competitive prices. 

Global MITS can design, build or rework your current network and stay in line with your company budget. We strive to provide you with the best solution at the lowest cost. We won't sell you products or services you don't need or want. If you're a small to medium, new or established business and you're looking for the ideal IT solution to fit your company structure and budget, Global MITS is the partner for you. </companyDescription>

         <companyDescription>Hotel@MIT was built to satisfy the need for a hotel that reflects MIT's spirit of innovation. Forest City Development Corporation and MIT forged a partnership to develop this venture. An MIT associate located on MIT property, the hotel and conference center features contemporary architecture outside and high-tech décor and amenities inside. Academics, businesspeople and travelers appreciate the whimsical, eclectic style and warm service. 

Recognized by its stunning exterior dome, our hotel anchors University Park Development, a premier office, high-tech and biomedical park near Central Square. The development offers a campus-like atmosphere in an urban setting. Its innovative master plan, developed by Koetter Kim and Associates, won the 1986 Urban Design Award from Progressive Architecture magazine. 

Arrowstreet was the architectural firm for the hotel, and Ahearn Schopfer and Associates provided the eclectic interior design. Hotel@MIT is managed by Hilton Hotels.  </companyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>In July of 2002 the MIT Soaring Association merged with the Greater Boston Soaring Association . MITSA was founded in 1968 in order to bring the joys and benefits of safe soaring to the community at a reasonable cost. Activities include flight training, gliding encampments, aircraft maintenance and social events. 

Cost reduction is achieved through the Club concept; MITSA is a volunteer organization where each member is expected to do his or her share in the considerable amount of work associated with soaring. Club policies and procedures are made by an elected board of directors. 

MITSA strives to provide a complete soaring environment. Primary instruction is available for the first time pilot as well as advanced training and activities in cross country, badge and contest flying for the more experienced member. </CompanyDescription>

         <companyDescription>In July of 2002 the MIT Soaring Association merged with the Greater Boston Soaring Association . MITSA was founded in 1968 in order to bring the joys and benefits of safe soaring to the community at a reasonable cost. Activities include flight training, gliding encampments, aircraft maintenance and social events. 

Cost reduction is achieved through the Club concept; MITSA is a volunteer organization where each member is expected to do his or her share in the considerable amount of work associated with soaring. Club policies and procedures are made by an elected board of directors. 

MITSA strives to provide a complete soaring environment. Primary instruction is available for the first time pilot as well as advanced training and activities in cross country, badge and contest flying for the more experienced member. </companyDescription>

         <CompanyDescription>In July of 2002 the MIT Soaring Association merged with the Greater Boston Soaring Association . MITSA was founded in 1968 in order to bring the joys and benefits of safe soaring to the community at a reasonable cost. Activities include flight training, gliding encampments, aircraft maintenance and social events. 

Cost reduction is achieved through the Club concept; MITSA is a volunteer organization where each member is expected to do his or her share in the considerable amount of work associated with soaring. Club policies and procedures are made by an elected board of directors. 

MITSA strives to provide a complete soaring environment. Primary instruction is available for the first time pilot as well as advanced training and activities in cross country, badge and contest flying for the more experienced member. </CompanyDescription>
